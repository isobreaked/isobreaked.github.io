<h1>Problem 2155 - 2025 XOOK, P1 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>For the Exeter disco party, Oron wants to tile a \(2024 \times 2024\) square in the middle of the dance floor with \(1 \times 1\) tiles which have arrows pointing either up, left, right, or down.</p>
<p>After placing down all the tiles in some configuration, he realizes that he wants to rotate some of the tiles so that no matter which tile a dancer starts on, after following the arrows they end up leaving the grid through some fixed cell. What&#x27;s the minimum number of tiles he needs to rotate so that this is always possible?</p>
