<h1>Problem 2168 - 2024 RMMSL, N2, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Let \(a_1\) be a positive integer and \(a_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \gcd(n, a_i)\) for any \(n\geq 2\). Prove that \(a_{n+1} \leq a_n\) for infinitely many \(n\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Suppose not, in which case for all sufficiently large \(n\), we have \(a_{n+1} > a_n\). I have a few ideas - looking at \(a_p\) where \(p\) is prime (so that maybe \(a_p < a_{p-1}\)), and looking at \((a_n, a_{nk})\), and also lower bounding. So of course, note that \(\gcd(p, a_i)\) for any \(i\) is going to be either \(1\) or \(p\). Also choose \(p > a_1\) (we need everything we can get). The idea is that using Dirichlet we can get \(p\) to be \(1\) modulo as many other primes as we want to help with forcing \(a_{p-1} > a_p\). Let's explicitly write out the condition for \(a_{p-1} > a_p\):
\[\sum_{i=1}^{p-2} \gcd(p - 1, a_i)  > \sum_{j = 1}^{p-1} \gcd(p, a_j)\]
Also, if we can just somehow find a \(p\) such that \(p \nmid a_i\) for all \(i < p\), we would be happy but that is probably hard to do. </p>
<p>Okay, if \(a_1\) is even, then all \(a_i\) must be even - and if \(a_1\) is odd, then \(a_2\) is odd, but all \(a_i\) for \(i \ge 3\) are even. Thus, for \(a_{p-1}\), this increases the lower bound to \(2(p - 4) + 2 = 2p - 6\), which unfortunately still means that even a single \(p\) in \(a_{< p}\) is enough to kill. Well, actually, using Dirichlet, we <i>can</i> force something bigger, so let's just say that we can only allow one \(p\) in \(a_{< p}\) for now. Actually, maybe we take \(p - 1\) divisible by everything upto the point where the sequence becomes strictly increasing and then do stuff? Unfortunately, if \(a_k\) is the point from where the sequence becomes strictly increasing, this only ensures that
\[a_{p-1} \ge \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i \right) + 2(p - k + 1)\]
but at least it's enough to allow one \(p\) in \(a_{< p}\). </p>
<p>So now let's assume there are \(2\) elements in \(a_{< p}\) that are divisible by \(p\). By the definition of \(p\), nothing from \(a_1\) to \(a_{k-1}\) is divisible by \(p\). The value of \(a_p\) becomes \(3p - 3\). But note that the value of the second element divisible by \(p\) is at least \(4p\), and since we have the strictly increasing property, \(4p < 3p -3\), which is impossible. Aha! Indeed, note that when there are \(r > 2\) numbers divisible by \(p\), the value of \(a_p\) becomes \((r+1)(p-1)\), and the value of the \(r\)th element of divisible by \(p\) is at least \(2rp\), so we must have \(2pr < (r + 1)(p - 1)\), which is impossible.  </p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>When lost, try to do some actual computations - maybe not ones with real numbers, but explicit algebraic computations of values like \(a_p\) prove to be useful, say, assuming there are exactly \(2\) things divisible by \(p\). Around the end, I got lost trying to see what exactly happens when there are \(2\) things divisible by \(p\), having not computed \(a_p\) - I was looking at \(a_{p+1}\) and trying to check whether we could somehow obtain \(a_p > a_{p+1}\). <i>Resource management</i> - use up the resources you have before going to find other resources. </p>
