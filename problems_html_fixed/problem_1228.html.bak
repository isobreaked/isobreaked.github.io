<h1>Problem 1228 - 2000 Putnam, A6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(f(x)\) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Define a sequence \(a_0 , a_1, \cdots\) of integers such that \(a_0 = 0\) and \(a_{n+1} = f(a_n)\) for all \(n \geq 0\). Prove that if there exists a positive integer \(m\) for which \(a_m = 0\) then either \(a_1 = 0\) or \(a_2 = 0\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class='skib'>
<p>
Suppose \(a_3 = 0\).  This means
\[0 - f(0) \mid f(0) - f(f(0)) \implies f(0) \mid f(f(0)), \;\;\;\; 0 - f(f(0)) \mid f(0) - f(f(f(0))) = f(0) \implies f(f(0)) \mid f(0)\]
Thus \(f(f(0)) = \pm f(0)\). However, note that \(f(0) - f(f(0)) \mid f(f(0)) - f(f(f(0))) = f(f(0))\), which means \(f(0) = 0\) in any case. I see it! For general \(a_m = 0\),
\[f(0) - 0 \mid f^2(0) - f(0) \mid \dots \mid f^m(0) - f^{m-1}(0) \mid f^{m+1}(0) - f^m(0) = f(0)\]
Thus we have that \(f^{i+1}(0) - f^i(0) = \pm f(0)\). If \(f^{i+1}(0) - f^i(0) = - (f^i(0) - f^{i-1}(0))\) for any \(i\) then we have \(f^{i+1}(0) = f^{i-1}(0)\), which means that \(f(0)\) or \(f(f(0))\) is \(0\). Otherwise we have \(f^{i+1}(0) + f^{i-1}(0) = 2f^i(0)\) for all \(i\), which means that the elements are in arithmetic progression which must have common difference \(0\), so \(f(0) = 0\).

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Can't see anything memorable, probably because it's just straightforward. \(a - b \mid P(a) - P(b)\) is goated as always. </p>
