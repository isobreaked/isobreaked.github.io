<h1>Problem 285 - 2005 China TST Day 2, P3 of 3</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(\alpha\) be a given positive real number. Find all functions \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that \[f(k + m) = f(k) + f(m)\] holds for any positive integers \(k, m\) satisfying \[\alpha m \leq k \leq (\alpha + 1)m.\]</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class='skib'>
<p>We really want surjectivity of \(k + m\) where \(\alpha m \le k \le \alpha m + m\), so we want to see what \(\{[\alpha m + m, \alpha m + 2m] \mid m\in \mathbb{N} \}\) covers. Clearly it doesn't cover \(1\), which is fine. </p>
<p>Note that for \(m \to m + 1 \), \(\alpha m + m \to \alpha m + m + (\alpha + 1)\) and \(\alpha m + 2m \to \alpha m + 2m + (\alpha + 2)\). But the thing is that \(\alpha m + m + \alpha + 1\) is not going to be more than \(\alpha m + 2m\), unless \(\alpha + 1 > m\). So for \(m \ge \alpha + 1\), everything (\(x \ge (\alpha+1)^2\)) can be expressed as a sum of two smaller things. </p>
<p>Wait - suppose \(\alpha m \le \alpha m + \alpha \le k \le \alpha m + m - 1 \le (\alpha + 1)m \le (\alpha+1)(m+1)\), then
\[f(m+1) + f(k) = f(m + k + 1) = f(k+1) + f(m), \;\; f(m+ k) = f(m) + f(k), \;\; f(m+k+2) = f(m+1)+f(k+1)\]
Basically, everything in the interval \((\alpha m + \alpha + m, \alpha m + 2m - 1)\) can be expressed as the average of its neighbours for all \(m\). Clearly every sufficiently large number is in one of these intervals. And now everything large has \(f(x) = cx\), we can go down and get \(f(x) = cx\) for every positive integer.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>You really want to express everything as the sum of something smaller but you can't exactly do that, and it's hard to deal with the `basis'. This technique is what I'll term an <b>indirect approach</b> to linearity. The <b>direct approach</b> to linearity is working locally and `determinately' with an element, showing that there is local linearity for all localities at sufficiently large values, leading to global linearity.</p>
