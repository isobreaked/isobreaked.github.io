<h1>Problem 2035 - Unknown</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Let \(n>1\) be an integer. Alice and Bob take turns marking unmarked points on the unit circle. Alice starts and marks her points red, while Bob marks his blue. They stop once each player has marked exactly \(n\) points. Each player's <i>score</i> is defined as the length of the longest arc of the circle which has both endpoints of that player's color and which doesn't contain any marked points in its interior, or \(0\) if such an arc doesn't exist.</p>
<p>If the scores are equal it's a tie, and otherwise the player with the higher score wins. Does one of the players have a winning strategy?</p>
