<h1>Problem 1341 - 2020 IMO, P5 of 6, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>A deck of \(n > 1\) cards is given. A positive integer is written on each card. The deck has the property that the arithmetic mean of the numbers on each pair of cards is also the geometric mean of the numbers on some collection of one or more cards.
For which \(n\) does it follow that the numbers on the cards are all equal?</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Of course, the arithmetic mean of any pair of numbers must be an integer - otherwise the geometric mean has to be some non-integer rational, which is not possible. Thus, either all the numbers are even, or they are all odd. If all the numbers are even, then all their \(\nu_2\) valuations must be the same - otherwise take the number with the smallest valuation \(s\) and a number with some other valuation - their arithmetic mean has a valuation of \(s - 1\), which is not attainable for any geometric mean. Even though all the numbers have an equal \(\nu_2\), we cannot just cancel out this factor that easily - the arithmetic mean can, in some scenarios, get a higher \(\nu_2\) than the geometric mean now.</p>
<p>Wait but can we not use a similar argument for all the primes to show that they have the same valuation? Suppose for a prime \(p\), there is a lowest valuation \(a\) and some other higher valuations. Then suppose there is some number with a higher valuation that is bigger than the biggest number with valuation \(a\). Taking the arithmetic mean of these two, we get a number with valuation \(a\), bigger than any with valuation \(a\), making it impossible to achieve through geometric mean. Otherwise, suppose there is some number with a higher valuation that is smaller than the smallest number with valuation \(a\). Taking the arithmetic mean of these two, we get a number with valuation \(a\), smaller than any with valuation \(a\), making it impossible to achieve through geometric mean.</p>
<p>Thus the numbers with valuation bigger than \(a\) are surrounded by everything with valuation \(a\). But hold up - if it was true that all the other primes in the world had equal valuations for all the numbers on the cards, then such a surrounding configuration would not be possible. This means that there are others contributing in a weird way to make this surrounding configuration happen. But wait again - if there are other primes with nonconstant valuation, then they must also be of similar form - everything with smallest valuation must surround everything with a bigger valuation. This means that the biggest number contains primes with equal or lower valuations to the numbers in the middle - never higher. Of course, such a composition of exponents can never lead to this number being the largest, a contradiction to our assumption that there even exists a prime such that the valuation is not constant. </p>
<p>Thus, for all \(n\) it holds that the numbers on all the cards must be the same.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Of course, the idea "All equal? More like all same \(\nu_p\)" strikes again. It starts off as \(\nu_2\) because I thought the arithmetic mean of \(2\) elements was more immediately related to \(\nu_2\). </p>
<p>When see arithmetic mean and geometric mean and stuff, note that the \(\nu_p\) of the arithmetic mean is only as strong as the lowest \(\nu_p\) (unless two people are the same), and the \(\nu_p\) of the geometric mean is the arithmetic mean of the \(\nu_p\) of everybody else (so clearly bigger than the AM \(\nu_p\) unless two people are the same).</p>
