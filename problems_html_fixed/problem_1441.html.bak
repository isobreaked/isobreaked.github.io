<h1>Problem 1441 - 2010 All-Russian MO, Grade 10, P4 of 8</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>In a county some pairs of towns are connected by two-way non-stop flights. From any town we can fly to any other, possibly transiting through other towns. Let an <i>odd cycle</i> be a series of flights which start and end at the same town and consist of an odd number of flights.  Suppose it's true that, if we close all the flights on any odd cycle, then we can find two towns for which we can no longer fly from one to the other.  Prove that we can partition the towns into four sets so that any flight connects towns from different sets.</p>
