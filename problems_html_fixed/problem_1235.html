	<h1>Problem 1235 - 2021 Hong Kong TST 2, P4, N</h1>
	<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
	<p>Does there exist a nonzero polynomial \(P(x)\) with integer coefficients satisfying both of the following conditions?
		<ul>
			<li>\(P(x)\) has no rational root;</li>
			<li>For every positive integer \(n\), there exists an integer \(m\) such that \(n\) divides \(P(m)\).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Thinking</h2>
		<div class=skib>
			<p>
				The first condition just means that \(P\) does not have a linear factor. The second condition is interesting - it's equivalent to saying that there exists an \(m\) for which \(p^a \mid P(m)\) for all primes \(p\) and exponents \(a\). Let's leave the exponents for later and just look at \(p \mid P(m)\). We know by Schur that there are infinitely many \(p\) in the prime set, but what must happen for this prime set to cover all primes? As with all things like this, there is no immediate result obtained. Even the answer is not clear. Can there be a quadratic irreducible polynomial that covers all the primes?
				\[p \mid x^2 + ax + b \implies \left(x + \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 \equiv \frac{a^2}{4} - b \pmod{p} \;\; \forall p\]
				We would really like it if \(a^2 - 4b\) (the discriminant) could be a square, but that polynomial would always have rational roots. Note also that \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is just \(a(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a})\), which leads to the same outcome. So a lone quadratic is not accomplishing anything. </p>
				<p>Do we know a finite set of non-square numbers such that at least one of them is quadratic residue modulo any prime \(p\)? Actually wait, we obviously do - we know certain numbers are always QRs modulo \(1 \pmod{4}\) and \(3 \pmod{4}\) and stuff. We know \(2\) is a quadratic residue modulo all \(1 \pmod{8}\) and \(7 \pmod{8}\) primes. Even better, we know \(-1\) is a quadratic residue modulo everything \(1 \pmod{4}\). This implies \(-2\) is a QR modulo all \(1\) and \(3 \pmod{8}\). So we actually know a no-linear-factor polynomial that goes through all primes:
					\[(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2)(x^2 -2)\]
				and a bunch more because we haven't utilized the discriminant yet.
			</p>
			<p>Actually wow, because we took quadratics, Hensel says there's no problems with higher powers either, apart from when \(p = 2\). But for \(p = 2\), this fails at \(2^2\) LOL. Okay but we can just multiply something that doesn't interfere with Hensel, like \(3x^3 + 1\), giving us the polynomial
			\[(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2)(x^2 -2)(3x^3 + 1)\]</p>
		</div>
	<h2>Idea</h2>
		<p>As it turns out, it's not that hard to make a polynomial's divisor set cover the integers, and a polynomial's prime set to cover the primes. Nice quadratic residue intuition with quadratics developed. And of course, Hensel is always in the back of our head because he's the goat.</p>
