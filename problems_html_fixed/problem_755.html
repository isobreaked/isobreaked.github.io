<h1>Problem 755 - 2019 Leaked RMM, P5 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>Two ants are moving along the edges of a convex polyhedron. The route of every ant ends in its starting point, so that one ant does not pass through the same point twice along its way. On every face \(F\) of the polyhedron are written the number of edges of \(F\) belonging to the route of the first ant and the number of edges of \(F\) belonging to the route of the second ant. Is there a polyhedron and a pair of routes described as above, such that only one face contains a pair of distinct numbers?</p>
