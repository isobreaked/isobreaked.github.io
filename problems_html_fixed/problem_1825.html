<h1>Problem 1825 - KÃ¶MaL A. 797</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>We call a system of non-empty sets \(H\) entwined, if for every disjoint pair of sets \(A\) and \(B\) in \(H\) there exists \(b\in B\) such that \(A\cup\{b\}\) is in \(H\) or there exists \(a\in A\) such that \(B\cup\{a\}\) is in \(H.\)</p>
<p>Let \(H\) be an entwined system of sets containing all of \(\{1\},\{2\},\ldots,\{n\}.\) Prove that if \(n>k(k+1)/2,\) then \(H\) contains a set with at least \(k+1\) elements, and this is sharp for every \(k,\) i.e. if \(n=k(k+1)/2\), it is possible that every set in \(H\) has at most \(k\) elements.</p>
<h2>Thinking (Mock)</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Let's look at a small case to understand what is going on. Suppose \(n = 7\), so \(k = 3\) and there should exist a set with \(k + 1= 4\) elements. Now, obviously the sets \(\{1, 2\}\), \(\{1, 3\}\), \(\dots\), \(\{6, 7\}\) all exist. Since \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4\}\) are disjoint, there is some set with \(3\) elements, say \(A\). Since there are \(4\) more elements left, we can construct another \(3\) element subset of those, say \(B\). Now since \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, and both are of size \(3\), we can get some set of size \(4\). What I've observed from this process is that when \(|A| = |B|\), it is at that point that it is optimal to do this operation. </p>
<p>Okay wait, this <i>is</i> just induction, isn't it? We know that we can construct a set of size \(k + 1\) if \(n > k(k+1)/2\), so if \(n > (k+1)(k+2)/2\), we can still construct our \(k+1\) element set \(A\), and then 
\[\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} - (k + 1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\]
So we can take these \(> k(k+1)/2\) elements and construct another, disjoint to \(A\) subset \(B\) with \(k + 1\) elements, and performing the operation gives a subset of size \(k + 2\).</p>
<p>Now to show that when \(n = k(k+1)/2\), then it is possible that nothing has \(> k\) elements. This reminds me of some weird chain-antichain thing. Surely this is just pattern recognition engineer induct. (spoiler: it is)</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Yeah, just induct. </p>
