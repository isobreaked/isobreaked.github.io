<h1>Problem 1119 - 2013 BalkanMO, P4 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends; friendship is always mutual, that is to say that when \(A\) is a friend of \(B\), then also \(B\) is a friend of \(A\). We say that \(n \geq 3\) different competitors \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\) form a <i>weakly-friendly cycle</i> if \(A_i\) is not a friend of \(A_{i+1}\), for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) (\(A_{n+1} = A_1\)), and there are no other pairs of non-friends among the components of this cycle.</p>
<p>The following property is satisfied:
\begin{quote}
for every competitor \(C\), and every weakly-friendly cycle \(\mathcal{S}\) of competitors not including \(C\), the set of competitors \(D\) in \(\mathcal{S}\) which are not friends of \(C\) has at most one element.
\end{quote}</p>
<p>Prove that all competitors of this mathematical competition can be arranged into three rooms, such that every two competitors that are in the same room are friends.</p>
