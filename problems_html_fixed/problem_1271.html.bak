<h1>Problem 1271 - 2022 IMO, P1 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminum (denoted A) and bronze (denoted B). Marianne has \(n\) aluminum coins and \(n\) bronze coins arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer \(k \leq 2n\), Gilberty repeatdly performs the following operation: he identifies the longest chain containing the \(k^{th}\) coin from the left and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if \(n=4\) and \(k=4\), the process starting from the ordering \(AABBBABA\) would be \(AABBBABA \to BBBAAABA \to AAABBBBA \to BBBBAAAA \to \dots\)</p>
<p>Find all pairs \((n,k)\) with \(1 \leq k \leq 2n\) such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost \(n\) coins will all be of the same type.</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class="skib">
<p>Clearly \(k \ge n\), otherwise, you can take the first \(k\) elements to be \(A\). </p>
<p>From this point on assume \(k \ge n\). If at any time a chain of length \(n\) is formed, then we are done.</p>
<p>Wait take \(k = 8\) and \(n = 4\) and the sequence \(ABABABAB\). This never forms a chain of any kind. This pattern doesn't hold for any \(k \neq 8\) though. Thinking along those lines though, \(n = 4\) also has the sequence \(AABBAABB\). This prevents \(k=7\) from working.<br><br>
I sense something about prime divisors.</p>
<p>I may or may not have misread the problem, I thought it was asking for all values of \(k\) that work for a general \(n\), not pairs \((n, k)\) that work. </p>
<p>Oh! That idea has nothing to do with `divisors' in particular. You can make up divisions of any size. For example, let \(n = 5\), then \(AAABBAABBB\) is a division that forbids \(k = 9\), where \(2n - k + 1\) is the size of the minimal chain. Also, there have to be an <b>even</b>, greater than \(2\) amount of chains when everything is put in a circle for this failure to occur. </p>
<p>So we have this bound of roughly \([n, 3n/2]\).</p>
<p>Note that a move never decreases the length of a chain, either keeps it constant or increases it. So we want to generate increases. Suppose the thing looks like \(A_1B_1A_2B_2\dots A_rB_r\) where \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) correspond to chains of \(A\)s and \(B\)s, respectively. Then anything that is not in the last chain \(B_r\) or the first chain \(A_1\) definitely increases some chain length. For our bound of \(k\), it's not going to be in the first chain unless we are done, and it can only be in the last chain for chains of length \(\ge n/2\). So we keep popping out the last chain and eventually we must stumble upon a chain that is \(\le n/2\) in size unless we are at \(A_1B_1\). </p>
