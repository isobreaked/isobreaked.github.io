<h1>Problem 1950 - 2023 IMOSL, N5, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Let \(a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots\) be positive integers such that \(a_{k+1}\) divides \(2(a_1+a_2+\dots+a_k)\) for every \(k\geqslant 1\). Suppose that for infinitely many primes \(p\), there exists \(k\) such that \(p\) divides \(a_k\). Prove that for every positive integer \(n\), there exists \(k\) such that \(n\) divides \(a_k\).</p>
<h2>Thinking (Mock)</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Let us first try to show that for all primes \(q\) there is some index \(k\) for which \(q \mid a_k\). This already seems unapproachable. Somehow we must use the conditions we have with <i>synergy</i>. Let us first show that there must exist some index \(i\) such that \(q \mid a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_i\). This is also severely nontrivial for whatever reason. Okay, let me denote by \(b_{k+1}\) the value \(2(a_1+a_2 + \dots + a_k)/a_{k+1}\). Then
\[2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k) = (b_k + 2)a_k\]</p>
<p>The fact that there exists such an index \(i\) for \(q\) means that we have no control over what the residues mod \(q\) want to do - which is so absurd because it looks like the problem is completely free (which in fact, deep down, we know is not because there are too many conditions). The problem is that these conditions are not implementable trivially into what we are doing.</p>
<p>Okay let's just work up from \(a_1\) and see what can possibly go wrong. So \(a_2 \mid 2a_1\), which means \(a_2 = 2a_1\). Then \(a_3 \mid 2(a_1 + 2a_1) = 6a_1\), which means \(a_3 = 3a_1\) or \(6a_1\). Then \(a_4 \mid 2(a_1 + a_2 + a_3)\) which means if \(a_3 = 3a_1\), then \(a_4 = 4a_1\), \(6a_1\), \(12a_1\) and if \(a_3 = 6a_1\), then \(a_4 = 9a_1\), \(18a_1\). Okay, so it's not true that \(a_1\) doesn't matter because if \(a_4 = 4a_1\), then \(a_5 = 20a_1/3 \) is an option.</p>
<p>Again, we somehow want to show that if \(q \nmid a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_i\) for any \(i\) then there are only finitely many primes dividing \(a_i\).</p>
<p><b>After mock+hint (conviction that \(b_k\) approach works)</b>: (Okay, let me go back to \(b_k\). By definition, \(2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{k-1}) = b_ka_k\). Wait, note that
\[(b_k + 2)a_k = b_{k+1}a_{k+1} = 2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k) \implies b_k + 2 > b_{k+1}\]
Omgggg wait so either \(b_i\) is bounded or \(b_i\) goes through every single integer value. Wait never mind because if \(b_i\) is bounded then the prime factors of \(a_i = a_{i-1}(b_{i-1}+2)/b_i\) will be bounded!!! So \(b_i\) goes through every single integer value, which means \(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_i\) is divisible by each \(n\) for some \(i\). And now we will take the point \(b_i\) where \(n = b_i\) and \(n + 1 = b_{i+1}\). This gives
\[(n + 2)a_i = (n+1) a_{i+1} = 2(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_i) \]
and since \(\gcd(n+1,n+2) = 1\), \(n + 1 \mid a_i\), and we are done.)
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>I am crying. Moral of the story: don't delete ideas from your mind. When trying out a new idea, <b>don't half-ass it</b>. In particular, writing out \((b_k + 2)a_k = b_{k+1}a_{k+1}\) quite literally just finishes. But abandoning ideas that 100% look like they are not going to work is not a bad idea either (as is displayed in this problem). </p>
<p>Also, it's crazy that I deleted such a wonderful factorization (which is exactly what I wanted, really) for \(\sum a_k\) when I had it. </p>
<p>The way an infinite prime set is dealt with here is a pretty common way (prime factors are bounded), but displayed in a weirder fashion - if the numerator and denominator in \(x_{i+1}/x_i\) are bounded, then the prime set of \(\{x_i\}\) is bounded.</p>
