<h1>Problem 1580 - 1997 APMO, P5 of 5</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Suppose that \(n\) people \(A_1\), \(A_2\), \(\ldots\), \(A_n\), (\(n \geq 3\)) are seated in a circle and that \(A_i\) has \(a_i\) objects such that
\[a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = nN\]
where \(N\) is a positive integer. In order that each person has the same number of objects, each person \(A_i\) is to give or to receive a certain number of objects to or from its two neighbours \(A_{i-1}\) and \(A_{i+1}\). (Here \(A_{n+1}\) means \(A_1\) and \(A_n\) means \(A_0\).) How should this redistribution be performed so that the total number of objects transferred is minimum?</p>
