<h1>Problem 463 - 2015 IMOSL, A1</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Suppose that a sequence \(a_1,a_2,\ldots\) of positive real numbers satisfies \[a_{k+1}\geq\frac{ka_k}{a_k^2+(k-1)}\]for every positive integer \(k\). Prove that \(a_1+a_2+\ldots+a_n\geq n\) for every \(n\geq2\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>
Here goes nothing (algebraic manipulation, am I right)
\[\frac{1}{a_{k+1}} \le \frac{a_k^2 + (k-1)}{ka_k} = \frac{a_k}{k} + \frac{k - 1}{ka_k}\]
\[\frac{1}{a_{k+1}} - \frac{1}{a_k} \le \frac{1}{k} \cdot [a_k - \frac{1}{a_k}]\]
</p>
<p> I think maybe something like Cauchy-Schwarz might be useful with all the reciprocals, so I'll just write it down
\[(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)[\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n}] \ge n^2\]
So we would like to show that 
\[\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n} \le n\]
</p>
<p>This is all well and good but I'm really bothered by the \(a_k\) showing up in \(a_k - (1/a_k)\) in the equation that has <i>only</i> reciprocals apart from that. We should try fixing that. Wait, maybe it doesn't need fixing because it's like positive of non-reciprocal and negative of reciprocal which works sort of fine? Let's do some algebra. Oh wait yooo
\[\frac{k}{a_{k+1}} \le a_k + \frac{k-1}{a_k}\]
If we make a function \(r/a_{r+1} = b_{r+1}\), then
\[b_{k+1} \le a_k + b_k\]
Now the idea is, clearly \(a_{n+1}\) doesn't have to be bigger than \(1\), so we must express <b>it</b> in terms of what we know is bigger than something.
\[\sum^n_{i=1} a_i \ge b_{n+1} = \frac{n}{a_{n+1}} \implies \sum^{n+1}_{i=1} a_i = a_{n+1} + \sum^n_{i=1} a_i \ge \frac{n}{\sum^n_{i=1} a_i} + \sum^n_{i=1} a_i\]</p>
Note that this <i>must</i> be true in any case, so we might as well try to look at why. The only thing we know about \(I = \sum^n a_i\) is that it should be \(\ge n\). Is it true that 
\[I + \frac{n}{I} \ge n + 1 \;\;\;\; \text{if } I \ge n\]
Oh bruh of course it is. The sum of values with fixed product gets larger as the variables spread apart, and equality is already achieved at \(I = n\), so we're done. </div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Just manipulation. Remember if getting opposite inequality signs what you want to do. Don't mindlessly aim for random inequalities. Look at the equality case.</p>
