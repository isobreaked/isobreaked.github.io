<h1>Problem 1265 - 2017 Sharygin Finals, 9.4, G</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Points \(M\) and \(K\) are chosen on lateral sides \(AB,AC\) of an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) and point \(D\) is chosen on \(BC\) such that \(AMDK\) is a parallelogram. Let the lines \(MK\) and \(BC\) meet at point \(L\), and let \(X,Y\) be the intersection points of \(AB,AC\) with the perpendicular line from \(D\) to \(BC\). Prove that the circle with center \(L\) and radius \(LD\) and the circumcircle of triangle \(AXY\) are tangent.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Splendid - to prove two circles are tangent at a point, here we have found a
circle that passes through said point and proven that it is orthogonal to both of
the original circles. This means that the tangent at that point to this new circle is
perpendicular to the tangent at that point to the old circles, implying that the two
original tangents coincide.<br><br>
We’ve also, in a spiral similarity, looked at the <i>other</i> similar sides, which we don’t
get much opportunity for unless we <i>know</i> those lengths are good - an example being
the sharkydevil configuration (\(BF/CE\) is good).</p>
