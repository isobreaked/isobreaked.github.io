<h1>Problem 2012 - 2023 USAMO, P5 of 6, CN</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(n\geq 3\) be an integer. We say that an arrangement of the numbers \(1\), \(2\), \(\dots\), \(n^2\) in a \(n \times n\) table is row-valid if the numbers in each row can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression, and column-valid if the numbers in each column can be permuted to form an arithmetic progression. For what values of \(n\) is it possible to transform any row-valid arrangement into a column-valid arrangement by permuting the numbers in each row?</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Try small cases and keep it simple, stupid - obviously the main idea for
composites is that eventually either a row must get skipped or it must repeat, so
the common difference must be \(n\). The point is only to find an appropriate element
which does this job smoothly for you.</p>
