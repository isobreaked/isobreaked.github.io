<h1>Problem 1258 - 2011 ToT Spring, Junior A-7</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>In every cell of a square table is a number. The sum of the largest two numbers in each row is \(a\) and the sum of the largest two numbers in each column is \(b\). Prove that \(a=b\).</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>We want to somehow take some sort of global summation, but don't know <i>what</i> to sum, <i>where</i> to sum, etc. Look at the greatest two elements of every single row - they sum up to \(an\). The best case scenario would be that this set is exactly the same set as the greatest two elements of every single column - but that doesn't have to be true.</p>
<p>The neat thing about grids is that what holds for columns holds for rows - so theoretically, showing \(a \ge b\) would be enough by symmetry. But let's not let that lousy reason be our motivation. If we were able to find a smaller subset of \(k\) columns and \(k\) rows where the top 2 elements of the \(k\) columns form the same set as the top 2 elements of the \(k\) rows, we would be done. </p>
<p>The main idea here is that we don't <i>need</i> it to be the same set as the top 2 elements of the \(k\) rows, we only need it to be the same set as <b>some two elements of the rows</b>. This would fetch us the inequality \(bn \ge an\) and we can hope by symmetry to obtain a similar set for columns. </p>
<p>Such a set does exist, and is the same as the following problem from <b>IMC 1999</b>:<br>
``Suppose that \(2n\) points of an \(n \times n\) grid are marked. Show that for some \(k > 1\) one can select \(2k\) distinct marked points, say \(a_1\), \(\dots\), \(a_{2k}\), such that \(a_{2iâˆ’1}\) and \(a_{2i}\) are in the same row, \(a_{2i}\) and \(a_{2i+1}\) are in the same column, \(\forall i\), indices taken mod \(2n\).''</p>
