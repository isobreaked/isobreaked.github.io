<h1>Problem 1789 - 2022 Singapore CWMI TST, P2 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(k\) be a positive integer. A \(2022k \times 2022k\) square is perfectly tiled with rectangles of dimension \(1 \times k\) without overlapping (rotation of tiles is allowed). Prove that there is a \(k \times k\) sub-square which is perfectly covered by \(k\) tiles.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Try to think about what <b>is</b> there, rather than what isn’t. Maybe I should
rephrase this as - if something is not <b>there</b> then something like the following happens:
<ul>
<li>Something else is <b>there</b>.</li>
<li>That something is <b>somewhere else</b>.</li>
</ul>
If there is symmetry, and something happens ‘horizontally’, then it also happens
‘vertically’.<br><br>
Finally, use small cases for more than just the answer - be vigilant in observing your
<i>thought process</i> when solving small cases.
