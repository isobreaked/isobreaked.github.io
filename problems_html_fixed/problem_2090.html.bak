<h1>Problem 2090 - 2020 Fake USAMO, P1 of 6, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Suppose that \(C\) is a positive integer and \(a_1,a_2,a_3,\cdots\) is an infinite sequence of positive integers satisfying
\[a_{n+1}=\sqrt{a_n^3-Ca_n}\]for all positive integers \(n\). Prove that this sequence must be eventually constant, i.e. there exists a positive integer \(N\) such that \(a_N = a_{N+1} = a_{N+2} = \cdots\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Suppose \(a_n\) is not a square, in which case there exists some prime \(p \mid a_n\) with \(\nu_p\) odd. Since \(a_n^3 - Ca_n\) is a perfect square, \(p \mid a_n^2 - C \implies p \mid C\) must hold. Observe that \(\nu_p(C)\) must be odd, and \(\nu_p(C) < 2\nu_p(a_n)\), unless \(\nu_p(C) = 2\nu_p(a_n)\). Also note that if there are infinitely many primes \(q\) like \(p\) dividing some \(a_i\) with odd \(\nu_q\), then \(C = 0\), which is just not possible since then \(a_1\) would have to be the square of a square of a square \(\dots\).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if \(p \mid a_k\) then \(p \mid a_{k+i}\) holds for all \(i \ge 0\). So suppose not all the primes in the prime set of \(\{a_i\}\) divide \(C\), and take one such prime \(r\) - from its first appearance onwards, \(\nu_r(a_n^3 - Ca_n)\) continues to strictly decrease until square-rooting is not possible anymore. Thus all the primes in the prime set of \(\{a_i\}\) do indeed divide \(C\). </p>
<p>Denote the prime set of \(\{a_i\}\) by \(P\). Since everything in \(P\) divides \(C\), everything in \(P\) has to divide \(a_1\) (and thus \(a_i\)) since no prime can randomly spawn.</p>
<p>Let us think of something better to do.
\[a_{n+1}^2 = a_n(a_n^2 - C)\]
We want to show that the \(\nu_p\) is constant so let's just try to directly do that.
\[2\nu_p(a_{n+1}) = \nu_p(a_n) + \nu_p(a_n^2 - C)\]
If the \(\nu_p(a_i)\) sequence is decreasing then it must become eventually constant. Suppose it instead increases here, that is, \(\nu_p(a_{n+1}) > \nu_p(a_n)\) which would mean \(\nu_p(a_n^2 - C) > \nu_p(a_n)\) and \(\nu_p(a_n^2 - C) > \nu_p(a_{n+1})\). This implies that \(\nu_p(C) > \nu_p(a_n)\) and \(\nu_p(C) > \nu_p(a_{n+1})\), so no matter what happens after \(a_{n+1}\), \(\nu_p(a_{n+i}) < \nu_p(C)\) will hold. Also note that if \(\nu_p(a_n) = \nu_p(a_{n+1})\), then this is also equal to \(\nu_p(C)\).</p>
<p>Thus, no matter what the circumstance (regardless of increasing or decreasing \(\nu_p\)), we obtain that for all primes in \(P\), the \(\nu_p\) eventually becomes \(\le \nu_p(C)\), so \(a_n \mid C\) for \(n > N\). Now observe that there is at most one valid value of \(x\) for which 
\[\sqrt{x^3 - Cx} < x\]
(around \(\sqrt{C} < x < \sqrt{C} + 1\)) by simple algebra, and if that value is achieved, then the sequence doesn't consist of positive integers anyways, so our sequence must be strictly increasing, unless it hits \(\sqrt{C}\). But now note that our sequence cannot be strictly increasing since \(a_i \mid C\), so we are done.</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Very suspicious. Really just look at equality cases. Clearly \(\nu_p\) analysis.</p>
