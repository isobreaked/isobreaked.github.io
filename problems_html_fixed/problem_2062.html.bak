<h1>Problem 2062 - Original</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>A game is played between two players, \(A\) and \(B\). First \(A\) picks a directed graph with at least \(2\) vertices such that if \(u\) is connected to \(v\) then \(v\) isn&#x27;t connected to \(u\). Then \(B\) picks the starting positions for \(A\) and \(B\), which must be in different positions. Now the game starts on \(A\)&#x27;s move, and then alternates between them. On \(A\)&#x27;s move, if she is at a vertex \(v\) with a path from \(u\) to \(v\), she can move to \(u\). If she has no legal moves, she loses. On \(B\)&#x27;s turn, he moves along a path (but in the right direction). If he has no legal moves he stays in place. If \(A\) and \(B\) are ever in the same vertex, \(B\) wins. If A never gets caught, she wins. Who wins?</p>
