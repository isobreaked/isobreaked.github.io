<h1>Problem 1803 - 2022 Taiwan TST Round 3, P4 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Let \(\mathbf{X}\) be the collection of all non-empty subsets (not necessarily finite) of the positive integer set 
\(\mathbf{N}\). Determine all functions \(f: \mathbf{X} \to \mathbf{R}^+\) satisfying the following properties: 
<ul>
<li>For all \(S\), \(T \in \mathbf{X}\) with \(S \subseteq T\), there holds \(f(T) \le f(S)\).</li>
<li>For all \(S\), \(T \in \mathbf{X}\), there hold 
\[f(S) + f(T) \le f(S + T), \;\;\;\; f(S)f(T) = f(S \cdot T),\]
where \(S + T = \{s + t \mid s \in S, t \in T\}\) and \(S \cdot T = \{s \cdot t \mid s \in S, t \in T\}\).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Consider the set \(\mathbf{N}\). We obtain 
\[f(\mathbf{N}) f(\mathbf{N}) = f(\mathbf{N}) \implies f(\mathbf{N}) = 1\]
Similarly, \(f(\{1\}) = 1\). So any set \(S\) with \(1 \in S\) satisfies \(f(S) \le 1\). But every set \(S\) is a subset of \(\mathbf{N}\), hence it holds that \(1 = f(\mathbf{N}) \le f(S)\). This implies \(f(S) = 1\) for all \(S\) containing \(1\).</p>
<p>For any set \(T\) with \(1\) not in \(T\), we can safely subtract \(1\) from all the elements of \(T\) to obtain a new subset of \(\mathbf{N}\) and get
\[f(T) \ge f(T') + f(\{1\}) \ge 1 + f(T') \ge 2\]
In fact, if \(n\) is the smallest element of \(T\), then we can actually say that \(f(T) \ge n\). Also note that for all sets \(S_n\) that contain \(n\) and only multiples of \(n\), \(f(S_n) = f(\{n\})\). I think I want to now show that for any set with \(n\) the smallest element, \(f(S_n) = f(\{n\})\). Let's start with \(n = 2\). </p>
<p>We know that for any set with \(2\) and only even numbers in it, \(f(S_2) = f(\{2\})\). Actually, if we can show that \(f(\{2\}) = f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1)\), we are done. This seems very hard. All the results I'm getting are with a reverse inequality - especially because \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash 1)\) can't be written as any product, and summing it with something makes us go to something with higher smallest element.</p>
<p>Okay, note that \(f\) is multiplicative and \(f\) is increasing (for singleton sets), so \(f(\{n\}) = n^c\) for all \(n\) for some fixed real \(c \ge 1\). So, again, all sets \(S\) that contain \(n\) and only multiples of \(n\) satisfy \(f(S) = n^c\).</p>
<p>We still want to show that \(f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1) = f(2) = 2^c\). We know \(2^c = f(2) \ge f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1)\). Somehow we want to get \(x \le f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1)\) for some \(x\), optimally \(2^c\). Of course we trivially have \(2 \le f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1)\). Flashbacks to "<i>All the results I'm getting are with a reverse inequality - especially because \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash 1)\) can't be written as any product, and summing it with something makes us go to something with higher smallest element.</i>" Okay, instead of ranting, let's think about what we actually want - directly doing something just doesn't give us anything, and adding doesn't give us anything. We have dismissed multiplication as something bad because it leads to composites or bad multiples. Maybe we do not care - 
\[f(\{2, 3, \dots\}) f(\{2, 3, \dots\}) = f(\{4, 6, 9, \dots\}) \ge f(\{3, 5, 8, \dots\}) + 1\]
All of this just leads to \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash 1) \ge 2\). This is untrue and I am not thinking straight, because the above actually gives
\[f(\{2, 3, \dots\}) f(\{2, 3, \dots\}) \ge f(3) + 1 = 3^c + 1 \implies f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1) \ge \sqrt{3^c + 1}\]
which is a wonderful bound, because we can generalize it to
\[f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1) \ge \left( (2^n - 1)^c + 1 \right)^{1/n} \implies f(\mathbf{N} \backslash 1) \ge 2^c\]
by taking \(n \to \infty\). YES!</p>
<p>So every set with \(2\) in it goes to \(2^c\). Similarly for \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\})\), note that we already have \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}) \le k^c\), and from the above procedure:
\[(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}))^n \ge f(k^n - 1) + 1 = (k^n - 1)^c + 1 \implies f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}) \ge ((k^n - 1)^c + 1)^{1/n}\]
which by taking \(n \to \infty\) gives \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}) \ge k^c\), implying \(f(\mathbf{N}\backslash \{1, 2, \dots, k-1\}) = k^c\), which means all sets with minimum integer \(k\) have \(f(S) = k^c\). Thus, our functions are of the form 
\[f(S) = (\min(S))^c \;\; \forall S\]
where all \(c \in \mathbf{R} \ge 1\) work.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>The fact that multiplicative and increasing combined give \(x^c\) should have come to me earlier but that's just whatever. The main idea is to just figure out what you can and cannot use because it's very clear what you want.</p>
