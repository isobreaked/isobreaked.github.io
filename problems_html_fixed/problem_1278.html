<h1>Problem 1278 - Five colour theorem, CG</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Tony Wang&#x27;s arch-nemesis, Bony Wang, has laid out some bowls on the floor and made some really long noodles which stretch between different bowls. He places these noodles in the bowls so that each noodle has its ends in different bowls. In an attempt to avoid dying, Bony has been careful not to make it appear that any two noodles cross if you look at this masterpiece from above. Bony challenges Tony to fill every bowl with Chinese Noodle Soup in such a way that no two bowls which share one of Bony&#x27;s noodles are filled with the same flavour of Chinese Noodle Soup. However, Tony only knows how to make five different flavours of Chinese Noodle Soup (and no mixing is allowed)! Show that Tony can still manage this task.</p>
