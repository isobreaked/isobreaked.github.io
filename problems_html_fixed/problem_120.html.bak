<h1>Problem 120 - 2019 USA TST, P3 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>A game of snake with the usual rules is played in an \(n \times n\) grid. For sufficiently large n, is it possible that a snake of length at least \(0.9n^2\) can be placed in the grid that after some amount of time the snake is in the same position, but in the opposite orientation? (i.e. the head is now where the tail was and vice versa)</p>
