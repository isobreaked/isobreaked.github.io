<h1>Problem 1467 - 2006 IMO, P2 of 6, CG</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Let \(P\) be a regular \(2006\)-gon. A diagonal is called <i>good</i> if its endpoints divide the boundary of \(P\) into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of \(P\). The sides of \(P\) are also called <i>good</i>.</p>
<p>Suppose \(P\) has been dissected into triangles by \(2003\) diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of \(P\). Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.</p>
