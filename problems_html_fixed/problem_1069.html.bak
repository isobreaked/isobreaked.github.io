<h1>Problem 1069 - Folklore</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>A maze is an \(8 \times 8\) board with some adjacent squares separated by walls, so that any two squares can be connected by a path not passing through any wall.  Given a command LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, a pawn in the maze makes a step in the corresponding direction unless it encounters a wall or an edge of the chessboard, in which case it does not move. An angel creates a list consisting of a finite sequence of commands and gives it to a devil, who then constructs a maze and places a pawn in one of the 64 squares.  Can the angel create a list which ensures that, no matter what the devil does, the pawn will visit every square?</p>
