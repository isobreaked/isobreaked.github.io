<h1>Problem 2076 - 2025 ToT Fall Round, Senior A5</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Merlinâ€™s castle has 100 rooms and 1000 corridors. Each corridor links two
of the rooms. Each pair of rooms is linked by at most one corridor. Merlin
has given out the plan of the castle to the wise men and declared the rules
of a challenge:
The wise men must scatter across the rooms in a manner of their
choosing. Each minute Merlin chooses a corridor and one of the
wise men must pass along that corridor from one of the rooms
joined by the corridor to the other one. Merlin wins if there are
no wise men in either room joined by the chosen corridor.
Denote a number \(m\) the magic number of the castle if \(m\) wise men can preagree before the challenge and act in such a way that Merlin never wins, \(m\)
being the minimal possible number.
What are the possible values of the magic number of the castle? (Merlin
and all the wise men always know the location of all the wise men).</p>
