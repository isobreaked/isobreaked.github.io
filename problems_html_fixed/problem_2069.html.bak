<h1>Problem 2069 - 2024 IGO advanced, P2 of 5, G</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Point \(P\) lies on the side \(CD\) of the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) such that \(\angle CBP = 90^{\circ}\). Let \(K\) be the intersection of \(AC,BP\) such that \(AK = AP = AD\). \(H\) is the projection of \(B\) onto the line \(AC\). Prove that \(\angle APH = 90^{\circ}\).</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a bad idea to mark all of the angles in a problem - but when it
is as ‘complicated as this’ with random nonsensical conditions floating around and
everything being intuitively expressible using one unknown, it’s a good idea.
It is probably not a good idea to overcomplicate a problem that already has a
lot of length conditions. For example, introducing \(BP \cap \omega\) seemed tempting but it is
obviously of no use.</p>
