<h1>Problem 533 - 1977 FIST, P4 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Prove that for each integer \(n > 1\) it is possible to construct a necklace having \(2n^2\) beads in all, these being of \(2n\) different colours, in such a way that for each pair of different colours there is at least one pair of adjacent beads of these two colours. Is it possible to do the same using \(2n^2 -1\) beads in all? Give a reason for your answer. (A <i>necklace</i> is a circular arrangement of beads, with no fastener intervening; an ample supply of beads of all the colours is assumed to be available)</p>
