<h1>Problem 1286 - 2022 Spring ToT, Senior A6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>The king assembled 300 wizards and gave them the following challenge. For this challenge, 25 colors can be used, and they are known to the wizards. Each of the wizards receives a hat in one of those 25 colors. If for each color the number of used hats would be written down then all these numbers would be different, and the wizards know this. Each wizard sees which hat was given to each other wizard but does not see his own hat. Simultaneously each wizard reports the color of his own hat. Is it possible for the wizards to coordinate their actions beforehand so that at least 150 of them would report correctly?</p>
