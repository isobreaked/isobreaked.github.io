<h1>Problem 2287 - DDGMaths Riddles Week 17, P4 of 4, G</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Pertifus got two tools for Christmas: a pencil that can mark the intersection of two lines, if they intersect at a unique point, and a pen that can draw the perpendicular bisector of two points, if they are distinct. Each tool will make a sad trumpet sound which he can hear if the respective condition isn&#x27;t met.</p>
<p>Pertifus also received an infinite, flat piece of paper, blank except for three marked points, the vertices of an acute scalene triangle T. Note that the edges of T are not drawn. Can he mark the centroid (center of mass) of T using his 2 tools only a finite number of times?</p>
