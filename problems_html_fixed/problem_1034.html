<h1>Problem 1034 - 2021 China National HS ML (Exam 2 of Prelims), P3 of 4, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(n \geq 4\) be an integer.  Prove that if \(n\) divides \(2^n-2\), then \(\frac{2^n-2}{n}\) is a composite number.</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class='skib'> 
<p>If \(n\) is odd, then \((2^n - 2)/n\) contains a factor of \(2\) and so by size, it must be composite. Suppose \(n\) is even, and \(n = 2k\). Then \((2^n - 2) / n = (2^{2k-1} - 1) / k\). If we could split \(2^{2k-1}\) into two nontrivial factors, both bigger than \(k\) (this is stronger than what we actually need), then we would be able to split \(2^{2k-1}/k\) into two nontrivial factors. For exmaple, if \(3 \mid 2k - 1\), then \(K = 2^{(2k-1)/3} - 1\) divides \(N = 2^{2k - 1} - 1\), and is bigger than \(k\) for non-small \(k\) - so is \(N/K\).</p>
<p>This strategy seems like it should work for all values of \(2k - 1\) that are not prime - because then we can split \(2k - 1\) into a factor that is at least \(\sqrt{2k-1}\). Then we just need to guarantee that \(2^{\sqrt{2k-1}} - 1 > k\), for which \(x \le 1\) must hold and we can check manually. The other factor is at least \((2^{2k-1} - 1)/(2^{(2k-1)/3} - 1)\), which is of course, obviously bigger than \(k\). </p>
<p>Now suppose \(2k -1\) is prime. Let us look at the divisors of \(2^p - 1\). Suppose \(q \mid 2^p - 1\). Then \(2^p \equiv 1 \pmod{q}\), which means that the order of \(2\) modulo \(q\) must be equal to \(p\). Thus, \(p \mid q - 1\), implying all prime divisors of \(2^p - 1\) are bigger than \(p\). So \((p+1)/2\) dividing \(2^p - 1\) is impossible. </p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>The bits at the start are simple enough. In the end, the takeaway is that when you have a <i>prime exponent</i> in a difference of powers expression, then use orders. </p>
