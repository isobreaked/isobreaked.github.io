<h1>Problem 1552 - Nim</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Tony and Joe are at the local Chinese noodle soup bar, on date night. Tony feels like letting his hair down today so he orders the first \(m\) items on the menu. For each \(k\), item \(k\) on the menu is a bowl with \(n_k\) noodles. When all the noodles arrive they play a game: a `turn&#x27; consists of picking one of the bowls and eating a positive whole number of the noodles from the bowl. Tony&#x27;s turn is first. Whoever ends up stuck (because all the noodles have been eaten) will be described to have a `tiny noodle&#x27; for the rest of eternity. For which \(m\) and \((n_1,\ldots,n_m)\) is Joe destined to have a tiny noodle, no matter how he plays (assuming Tony plays optimally)?</p>
