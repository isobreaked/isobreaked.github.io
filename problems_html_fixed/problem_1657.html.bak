<h1>Problem 1657 - 2021 IMOSL, C4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>The kingdom of Anisotropy consists of \(n\) cities. For every two cities there exists exactly one direct one-way road between them. We say that a path from \(X\) to \(Y\) is a sequence of roads such that one can move from \(X\) to \(Y\) along this sequence without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection.</p>
<p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two distinct cities in Anisotropy. Let \(N_{AB}\) denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from \(A\) to \(B\). Similarly, let \(N_{BA}\) denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from \(B\) to \(A\). Prove that the equality \(N_{AB} = N_{BA}\) holds if and only if the number of roads going out from \(A\) is the same as the number of roads going out from \(B\).</p>
