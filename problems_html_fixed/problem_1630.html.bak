<h1>Problem 1630 - 2023 Taiwan IMOC, G6, G</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Triangle \(ABC\) has circumcenter \(O\). \(D\) is the foot from \(A\) to \(BC\), and \(P\) is apoint on \(AD\). The feet from \(P\) to \(CA, AB\) are \(E, F\), respectively, and the foot from \(D\) to \(EF\) is \(T\). \(AO\) meets \((ABC)\) again at \(A'\). \(A'D\) meets \((ABC)\) again at \(R\). If \(Q\) is a point on \(AO\) satisfying \(\angle ABP = \angle QBC\), prove that \(D, P, T, R\) lie on acircle and \(DQ\) is tangent to it.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>To prove they lie on a circle is standard. To prove that a line \(\ell\) is tangent to a
circle at a point \(X\), a convenient idea displayed here is to look at the antipode \(X'\) of
\(X\) - if one can show \(XX' \perp \ell\), then they are done. Another cute idea here, as in the
last problem is to use Desargues (look for perspectivities actively).</p>
