<h1>Problem 1858 - 2024 EGMO, P3 of 6, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>We call a positive integer \(n{}\) peculiar if, for any positive divisor \(d{}\) of \(n{}\) the integer \(d(d + 1)\) divides \(n(n + 1).\) Prove that for any four different peculiar positive integers \(A, B, C\) and \(D{}\) the following holds:
\[\gcd(A, B, C, D) = 1.\]</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Suppose some prime \(p\) is the smallest prime dividing \(\gcd(A, B, C, D)\). Then \(p \mid A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\). Then \(p(p+1) \mid A(A+1)\), \(B(B+1)\), \(C(C+1)\), \(D(D+1)\). It feels important to <i>``why things are true?''</i> here. Also interestingly the problem implies that there are not \( >3 \) peculiar numbers that are even. Ah wait that is clearly true - if \(n\) even is peculiar then \((n/2)(n/2 + 1) \mid n(n+1)\), which just cannot be true for a multitude of reasons for any \(n \neq 2\). A similar argument `should' work but it can't be that simple.</p>
<p>So note that if \(n\) is peculiar and \(p \mid n\) is the smallest prime factor of \(n\), then 
\[\frac{n}{p} \cdot [\frac{n}{p} + 1]\mid n(n+1), \;\;\;\; \frac{n}{p} + 1 \mid p(n+1)\]
\[n + p \mid p^2(p - 1), \;\;\;\; n' + 1 \mid p(p - 1)\]</p>
<p>Suppose \(p \nmid n' + 1\). Then \(n' + 1 \mid p -1\), which means \(n' < p\), and since \(p\) is the smallest prime factor of \(n\), \(n'\) must be equal to \(1\). Thus \(n = p\), which is a working solution. Otherwise \(p \mid n' + 1\). So let \(n' = pn'' - 1\), and \(n'' \mid p - 1\). But this means \(n' < p^2\), and since \(p\) is the smallest prime dividing \(n\), \(n'\) must be a prime.</p>
<p>Wait so the only possible peculiar numbers are of form \(p\) (which always works) or \(pq\). 
\[p+1 \mid q(q - 1), \;\;\;\; q+1 \mid p(p - 1)\]
Suppose \(q > p\). If \(p \nmid q + 1\), then \(q + 1 \mid p - 1\), which is not possible, so \(p \mid q + 1\), and \(q = pk - 1\) for some \(1 < k < p\). Also by size \(p + 1 \mid q(q - 1)\) means \(p + 1 \mid q - 1\), so
\[p + 1 \mid pk - 2 \implies p + 1 \mid k + 2 \implies k = p - 1 \implies q = p^2 - p - 1\]</p>
<p>Thus we have proved that there is exactly one number \(q\) for every \(p\) such that \(pq\) is peculiar. Similarly there can only be exactly be one number \(q' < p\) such that \(q'p\) is peculiar, the solution to \(x^2 - x - 1 = p\). And the third peculiar number with factor \(p\) is \(p\) itself. So we are done.</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Remember - assigning variables to quantities in number theory is good! But once in a while, you probably want to write things out in terms of the original to get a feel for what's going on. Also remember the size. </p>
