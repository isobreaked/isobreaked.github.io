<h1>Problem 551 - 2020 Tournament of Towns Senior A, P7 of 7</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Consider an infinite white plane divided into square cells. For which \(k\) it is possible to paint a positive finite number of cells black so that on each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line of cells there is either exactly \(k\) black cells or none at all?</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>It feels as though two approaches would exist to this problem: one is the local approach where we simply look at some sort of an extremal element, or some process that allows us to change our focus from one element to another eventually leading to an element that must be contradictory. The other approach appears connected since in the end it too gives rise to local contradictions, but it is in a global way - this approach would somehow be able to encapsulate certain data about the whole system and according to some or the other law (or collected local information) show why this is incorrect. </p> 
<p>Let us first look at the element that is the most "down-left". This means that \(x + y\) is minimum, but this is one of our diagonal lines, so in fact there must be \(k\) elements that are the most "down-left". Also note that these elements might be completely distinct from the elements that are the most "down" - that is, \(y\) is minimum, which is one of our horizontal lines and comprises of \(k\) elements as well. Thinking along these lines I have coincidentally come across a construction for \(k = 2\), which I formerly thought was unachieveable. The construction is an octagon, illustrated below
\[\begin{matrix} \cdot & \odot & \odot & \cdot \\ \odot & \cdot & \cdot & \odot \\ \odot & \cdot & \cdot & \odot \\ \cdot & \odot & \odot & \cdot \end{matrix}\]</p>
<p>Due to our fear of being terribly incorrect, this leads to us abandoning our local approach, knowing that we might get constraints but afraid still that there might be a construction. Note that there are \(k - 1\) rows and \(k - 1\) columns of black cells generated by a single black cell (not counting diagonal generation). I here thought about taking a graph theoretic view, but that seems to not look very good. </p>
<p>Okay I spoiled myself on the answer. It's yes for all \(k\). I'm about to crash out. The construction now should not be hard to get since we know the answer.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Do not crash out in yes/no problems. Apply as much force to trying to prove 'no' as to trying to prove 'yes', if the first thing you try to prove does not work. I don't know. </p>
