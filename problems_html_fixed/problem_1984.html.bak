<h1>Problem 1984 - Folklore</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>A country consists of \(2^k\) cities and between each pair of cities there is a train connection that runs in both directions. Each train connection has its own distinct travel time. An <i>undercover route</i> is a series of train rides between cities (cities can be repeated) such that the travel time of consecutive train rides is decreasing. <br><br> Determine the largest integer \(m\) (depending on \(k\)), such that there always exists an undercover route consisting of at least \(m\) train rides.</p>
