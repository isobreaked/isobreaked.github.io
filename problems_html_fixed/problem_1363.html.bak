<h1>Problem 1363 - 2023 Israel MO, P6 of 7</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Determine if there exists a set \(S\) of \(5783\) different real numbers with the following property:
For every \(a,b\in S\) (not necessarily distinct) there are \(c\neq d\) in \(S\) so that \(a\cdot b=c+d\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class = skib>
<p>We obtain that \(|x|\) for \(x \in S\) should be \(< 2\). Also I have this idea about powers of \(1/\phi\) (not \(\phi\) since we want things to be \(< 2\)). Since \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\), I expect something interesting to happen - the relation with \(1/\phi\), which I will call \(\Phi\) is \(\Phi^2 = 1 - \Phi\).</p>
<p>Also we should figure out things like whether \(0\) appears in our set, whether \(1\) appears in our set, and whether negations must necessarily appear in our set. It seems nothing is necessary, but we should let \(1\) be in our set to satisfy our dream of powers of \(\Phi\). This would imply that every element \(x \in S\) can be written as the sum of two distinct elements in \(S\).</p>
<p>Let us look at the set 
\[\{-\Phi^{2890}, -\Phi^{2889}, \dots, -\Phi^2, -\Phi, -1, 0, 1, \Phi, \Phi^2 \dots, \Phi^{2889}, \Phi^{2890}\}\]
So here's the problem with this: consider \(\Phi^{5780}\). This should be expressible as the sum of two distinct elements in \(S\) but it isn't - partly because our recurrence for \(\Phi\) doesn't go that deep, but also what I feel like is the more major issue is that the size of this number is far too close to zero for two other numbers in our set to have a separation of size 'this'.</p>
<p>Basically, arrange numbers by absolute value. Then the two nonzero elements with the smallest absolute values, let them be \(a\) and \(b\), consider their product. Some two numbers in this list of absolute values must have separation exactly \(ab\) (if 'perfect' negation exists). Also I think we should replace \(\Phi\) to be equal to \((-1 + \sqrt{5})/2\) since that would satisfy \(\Phi^2 = \Phi + 1\), even though it is negative (the same set is formed). The problem at hand still stands though. </p>
<p>The problem with taking powers of something lesser than \(1\) is that things become too small. The problem with taking powers of something bigger than \(1\) is that things become too big... is that true? Suppose \(x < 1\), and we take a set similar to the one described above. Then \(x^{5780}\) should be \(x^{i} - x^j = x^i(1 - x^{j-i})\) for some \(0 \le i \le j \le 2890\). This means \(x^{5780 - i} + x^{j-i} = 1\), which actually might be possible. Suppose \(i = 2889\), \(j = 2890\) (which is in some sense the best possible thing you can choose - the <b>extremal</b> (?) \(x\)), then \(x^{2891} + x = 1\) - this does have a root between \(0\) and \(1\). </p>
<p>So we can express \(x^{2890 + i} = x^{i-1} - x^i\), and we only need to go from \(i = 1\) to \(2890\) so we're fine, and similarly for \(-x^{2890 + i}\). That's wild.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Restrict freedom, look at failing ideas and transform them. But also ditch them if they don't work for too long.</p>
