<h1>Problem 2237 - 2025 Balkan MO, P4 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>There are \(n\) cities in a country, where \(n \geq 100\) is an integer. Some pairs of cities are connected by direct (two-way) flights. For two cities \(A\) and \(B\) we define:
<ol><li> A <i>path</i> between \(A\) and \(B\) as a sequence of distinct cities \(A = C_0, C_1, \dots, C_k, C_{k+1} = B\), \(k \geq 0\), such that there are direct flights between \(C_i\) and \(C_{i+1}\) for every \(0 \leq i \leq k\);</li>
<li> A <i>long path</i> between \(A\) and \(B\) as a path between \(A\) and \(B\) such that no other path between \(A\) and \(B\) has more cities;</li>
<li> A <i>short path</i> between \(A\) and \(B\) as a path between \(A\) and \(B\) such that no other path between \(A\) and \(B\) has fewer cities.</li></ol>
Assume that for any pair of cities \(A\) and \(B\) in the country, there exist a long path and a short path between them that have no cities in common (except \(A\) and \(B\)). Let \(F\) be the total number of pairs of cities in the country that are connected by direct flights. In terms of \(n\), find all possible values \(F\)</p>
