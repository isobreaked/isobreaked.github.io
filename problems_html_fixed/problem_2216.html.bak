<h1>Problem 2216 - Feb 2018 USACO, P3</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>The stage layout for a new act involves \(N\) platforms arranged in a circle.
  On each platform, between \(1\) and \(N\) cows must form a stack, cow upon cow upon cow.
  When the ringmaster gives the signal, all stacks must simultaneously
  fall clockwise, so that the bottom cow in a stack doesn&#x27;t move, the cow
  above her moves one platform clockwise, the next cow moves two platforms
  clockwise, and so forth. Being accomplished gymnasts, the cows know they
  will have no trouble with the technical aspect of this act. The various
  stacks of cows will not ``interfere&#x27;&#x27; with each other as they fall, so
  every cow will land on the intended platform. All of the cows landing on
  a platform form a new stack, which does not fall over.</p>
<p>The ringmaster thinks the act will be particularly dramatic if after the stacks fall,
  the new stack on each platform contains the same number of cows as the original stack on that platform.
  We call a configuration of stack sizes ``magical&#x27;&#x27; if it satisfies this condition.
  Find an explicit expression for the number of magical configurations in terms of \(N\).</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p> There is a lot of intuitive symmetry here. The answer (and the solution)
is obvious after some small cases. </p>
