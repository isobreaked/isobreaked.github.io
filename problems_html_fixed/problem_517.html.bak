<h1>Problem 517 - 2020 RMM, P3 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>Let \(n\ge 3\) be an integer. In a country there are \(n\) airports and \(n\) airlines operating two-way flights. For each airline, there is an odd integer \(m\ge 3\), and \(m\) distinct airports \(c_1, \dots, c_m\), where the flights offered by the airline are exactly those between the following pairs of airports: \(c_1\) and \(c_2\); \(c_2\) and \(c_3\); \(\dots\) ; \(c_{m-1}\) and \(c_m\); \(c_m\) and \(c_1\).</p>
<p>Prove that there is a closed route consisting of an odd number of flights where no two flights are operated by the same airline.</p>
