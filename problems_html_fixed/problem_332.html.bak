<h1>Problem 332 - 2019 AUS $\to$ UNK F3, P1 of 3</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>The city of Loopdon has several circular ring roads which are divided into arcs which meet at junctions. It is known that one can drive from any point on a road to any other point on a road by travelling at most 100km. However, the Environmental Agency needs to shut down one arc on each ring road to reduce pollution. Can they choose which arcs to shut down so that it is still possible to drive from any point on an open road to any other point on an open road by travelling at most 200km?</p>
