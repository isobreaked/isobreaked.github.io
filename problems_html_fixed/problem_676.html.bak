<h1>Problem 676 - 2016 IMO, P2 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Find all integers \(n\) for which each cell of \(n \times n\) table can be filled with one of the letters \(I,M\) and \(O\) in such a way that:<ul><li>in each row and each column, one third of the entries are \(I\), one third are \(M\) and one third are \(O\); and</li><li>in any diagonal, if the number of entries on the diagonal is a multiple of three, then one third of the entries are \(I\), one third are \(M\) and one third are \(O\).</li></ul><b>Note.</b> The rows and columns of an \(n \times n\) table are each labelled \(1\) to \(n\) in a natural order. Thus each cell corresponds to a pair of positive integer \((i,j)\) with \(1 \le i,j \le n\). For \(n>1\), the table has \(4n-2\) diagonals of two types. A diagonal of first type consists all cells \((i,j)\)  for which \(i+j\) is a constant, and the diagonal of this second type consists all cells \((i,j)\) for which \(i-j\) is constant.</p>
