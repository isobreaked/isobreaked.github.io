<h1>Problem 923 - 2019 IMOSL, C4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>
On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth \(\mathcal{L}\) consisting of \(n\) walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.<br><br>
At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.<br><br>
After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.<br><br>
Let \(k(\mathcal{L})\) be the largest number \(k\) such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth \(\mathcal{L},\) Morgana can always place at least \(k\) knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each \(n,\) what are all possible values for \(k(\mathcal{L}),\) where \(\mathcal{L}\) is a labyrinth with \(n\) walls?</p>
