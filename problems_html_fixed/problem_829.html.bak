<h1>Problem 829 - 2018 IMO, P4 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>A <i>site</i> is any point \((x, y)\) in the plane such that \(x\) and \(y\) are both positive integers less than or equal to 20.</p>
<p>Initially, each of the 400 sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns placing stones with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red stones is not equal to \(\sqrt{5}\). On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any other occupied site.) They stop as soon as a player cannot place a stone.</p>
<p>Find the greatest \(K\) such that Amy can ensure that she places at least \(K\) red stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.</p>
