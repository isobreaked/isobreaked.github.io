<h1>Problem 1146 - 2021 RMM, P5 of 6, GC</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Let \(n\) be a positive integer. The kingdom of Zoomtopia is a convex polygon with integer sides, perimeter \(6n\), and \(60^\circ\) rotational symmetry (that is, there is a point \(O\) such that a \(60^\circ\) rotation about \(O\) maps the polygon to itself). In light of the pandemic, the government of Zoomtopia would like to relocate its \(3n^2+3n+1\) citizens at \(3n^2+3n+1\) points in the kingdom so that every two citizens have a distance of at least \(1\) for proper social distancing. Prove that this is possible. (The kingdom is assumed to contain its boundary.)</p>
