<h1>Problem 2245 - 2010 IMOSL, A4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>A sequence \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) is defined by \(x_1 = 1\) and \(x_{2k}=-x_k, x_{2k-1} = (-1)^{k+1}x_k\) for all \(k \geq 1.\) Prove that \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n \geq 0\) for all \(n\geq 1\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Let us look at what the sequence looks like:
\[+,\;\; -,\;\; ++,\;\; +---,\;\; +-++-+++,\;\; +-+++----+--+---\]
Note that \(x_{2k-1} = x_{2k}\) iff \(k\) is even, and they are of differing signs when \(k\) is odd. So basically it's like 2 same, then 2 different, then 2 same, and so on. Interestingly, the sum is \(0\) at \(n = 2\), \(n = 8\), \(n = 32\). We'll look at what happens at odd indices later (because \(-+\)) for now let's look at even indices. For even indices, note that half of the world is opposite signs, and we only care about when \(x_{4k-1} x_{4k}\) happens, because they are the same sign. But note that they're the opposite sign of \(x_{2k}\) so we want to show that the summation of \(x_{2k}\) is always negative - and \(x_{2k}\) is the negative of \(x_k\) so we want to show that the summation of \(x_k\) is positive up till approximately \(n/4\). </p>
<p>So there's this inductive feel but unfortunately for us, we haven't yet shown odd indices and have no idea how hard that will be. Thus suppose there is some index \(x_{2k+1}\) such that it is a \(-\) and it goes to \(-1\). This means that \(x_{2k-1}x_{2k}\) was certainly not a \(++\), nor was it a \(-+\). Thus \(x_{2k}\) must have been a \(-\). Wait also we know that \(x_{2k+2}\) should be positive by some sort of weird induction since it traces back to \(n/4\). So \(x_{2k+2}\) is a \(+\), which means \(x_{2k+1}x_{2k+2}\) has been a \(-+\), implying \(x_{2k-1}x_{2k}\) were \(--\). This means that \(2 \mid k\), so let \(k = 2m\).</p>
<p>We have \(x_{4m - 1} = (-)\), \(x_{4m} = (-)\), \(x_{4m + 1} = (-)\), \(x_{4m+2} = (+)\). This means \(x_{2m} = (+)\), \(x_{2m+1} = (-)\), which further implies \(x_m = (-)\), and \(x_{m+1} = (-)^{m+1}\). This implies \(x_{2m+2} = (-)^{m+2}\). We know that \(x_{4m + 3} = x_{4m+4}\), and if they are \((-)\), then the sum till \(x_{4m+4}\) will be negative which is not possible. So \(x_{4m+3} = x_{4m+4} = (+)\). This means \(x_{2m+2} = (-) = (-)^{m+2}\), so \(m\) is odd. </p>
<p>So we have 
\[x_{4m-1}x_{4m}x_{4m+1}x_{4m+2}x_{4m+3}x_{4m+4} = (---+++)\]
\[x_{2m}x_{2m+1}x_{2m+2} = (+--)\]
\[x_{m} x_{m+1} = (-+)\]
We know \(m\) is odd, and also obtain \(m \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\), and we know there's got to be a contradiction lurking somewhere around here\(\dots\) unless something global is going on. Oh! Remember that if the sum at \(4m\) is \(0\), then the sum at \(m\) would also be \(0\), but this is clearly not true since \(m\) is odd. </p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Trust the induction (until when you shouldn't). Write things down properly - for example, remembering the sum at \(4m\) is twice the sum at \(m\) would not be unnatural if the previous claims and/or observations were written properly.</p>
