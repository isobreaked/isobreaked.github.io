<h1>Problem 1711 - 2008 All-Russian MO, Grade 11, P3 of 8, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Given a finite set \(P\) of prime numbers, prove that there exists a positive integer \(x\) which is representable in the form \(x=a^p+b^p\) (with \(a,b \in \mathbf{N}\)) for each \(p \in P\), but not representable in that form for any prime \(p \notin P\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>When is a number expressible as \(n = a^p + b^p\) for \(a\), \(b \in \mathbf{N}\)? Also obviously everything except \(2\) smaller than \(2^k + 1\) cannot be expressed as \(a^{\ge k} + b^{\ge k}\), although this is a terrible bound because for \(q\) close to \(k\), it is likely not true that \(a^q + b^q < 2^k + 1\). In any case, we at least know that obviously after a certain prime \(r\) our number cannot be expressed as a sum of \(r\)th powers.</p>
<p>Suppose \(Q\) is the finite set of all primes till that one particular prime after which by size we know that \(x\) cannot be expressed as a sum of powers and note \(P \subset Q\). Now to show that the things inside \(Q\) but not in \(P\) cannot represent \(x\), we need to probably do some modular arithmetic. But how? \(a^p + b^p \equiv a + b \pmod{p}\) which can literally be anything. So maybe we keep doing some random size things?</p>
<p>Okay let's just look at \(p = 3\). When is something expressible as \(a^3 + b^3\)? Also interestingly important to remember is \(a\), \(b \in\mathbf{N}\). Wait, also note that \(a^p + a^p < (a+1)^p\) for sufficiently large \(p\) and sufficiently small \(a\). This seems to be useless though. In any case,
\[(1, 1), (8, 1), (8, 8), (27, 1), (27, 8), (27, 27), (64, 1), (64, 8), (64, 27), (64, 64)\]
Okay so at least we do know that the number of solutions of \(a^p + b^p \le n\) is very low.</p>
<p>Also LOL I was thinking of using Fermat's last somehow but then making it satisfy things for \(P\) and <i>also</i> satisfy strong things for everyone else will make it larger and larger and increase the number of conditions. Yeah idk maybe the better question to ask is what <i>cannot</i> be expressed as \(a^p + b^p\) for some \(p\).</p>
<p>Maybe the solution is just size. But to be fair, note that \(a^3 + b^3 \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\} \pmod{9}\), and \(a^5 + b^5 \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\} \pmod{11}\). So for \(p\), if we take a prime \(q\) with \(q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\) then most residues \(\pmod{q}\) are not attainable for \(a^p + b^p\). </p>
<p>Also there's a lot of ideas that don't work. For example if we have \(P' = \prod_{p_i \in P} p_i\), then \(2^{P'} + 1\) not being expressible as \(x^q + y^q\) for \(q \not \in P\) would be crazy but that's not necessarily true. Wait I'm starting to doubt this. In fact, I now think that it <i>is</i> a construction problem. Like, there's no way (meta-gaming) it's actually some nontrivial hard stuff.</p>
<p>Suppose \(x^q + y^q = 2^p + 1\), and \(r \mid 2^p + 1\) is a prime. Wait I have another vision. Take \(2^n + 2^n = 2^{n+1}\) instead of \(2^n\). Suppose \(x^q + y^q= 2^{n+1}\). It is clear that \(\nu_2(x) = \nu_2(y) = r\), so let \(x=2^r a\), \(y = 2^r b\), and \(a^q + b^q = 2^{n + 1 - rq}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. But now note that if \(q \neq 2\) then \(a + b\) must be a power of \(2\). Wait also \(a^{q-1} + a^{q-2}b + \dots + ab^{q-2} + b^{q-1}\) has \(q\) terms which means it must be odd, and since it divides \(2^{n + 1 - rq}\), we have
\[a^{q-1} + a^{q-2}b + \dots + ab^{q-2} + b^{q-1} = 1 \implies a^q + b^q = a + b\]
Since \(q > 2\) this is only possible if \(a = b = 1\), but this means \(x = 2^r\), \(y = 2^r\), and \(qr + 1 = n + 1\) which means \(q \mid n\), a contradiction of the form we were looking for.</p>
<p>Now if \(q = 2\) then \(a^2 + b^2 = 2^{n + 1 - 2r}\), but this means \(a\) and \(b\) are even unless \(n + 1 - 2r = 1\), which would mean \(n\) is even, or \(2\) is included in it, a contradiction.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Think simple. Meta-game the solution - it's d6 so it can't possibly involve random nontrivial tech and is almost certainly a simple construction. </p>
