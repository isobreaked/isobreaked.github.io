<h1>Problem 1832 - 2023 APMO, P5 of 5, CG</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>There are \(n\) line segments on the plane, no three intersecting at a point, and each pair intersecting once in their respective interiors. Tony Wang and his \(2n - 1\) friends each stand at a distinct endpoint of a line segment. Tony Wang wishes to send bowls of Chinese noodle soup to each of his friends as follows:
First, he chooses an endpoint of each segment as a “delivery destination”. Then he places the bowl of Chinese noodle soup at the endpoint of the segment he is at. The bowl of Chinese noodle soup moves as follows :<ul><li>If it is on a line segment, it moves towards the delivery destination.</li><li>When it reaches an intersection of two segments, it changes the line segment it travels on and starts moving towards the new delivery destination.</li></ul>
If the bowl of Chinese noodle soup reaches an endpoint, the friend on that endpoint can receive and eat it. 
Prove that Tony Wang can send bowls of Chinese noodle soup to exactly \(n\) of his \(2n - 1\) friends.</p>
