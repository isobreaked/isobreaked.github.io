<h1>Problem 2208 - 2025 Serbia MO, P5 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>In Mexico, there are \(n\) Mexicans, some of whom know each other(pairwise). They decided to play a game. On the first day, each Mexican writes a non-negative integer on their forehead. On each subsequent day, every Mexican changes the number on their forehead according to the following rule:  
On day \(i+1\), each Mexican writes the smallest non-negative integer that none of their acquaintances had on their forehead on day \(i\).</p>
<p>It is known that at some point, every Mexican wrote the same number on their forehead as the day before, and at that moment they decided to stop playing.</p>
<p>Determine the maximum number of days this game could have lasted.</p>
