<h1>Problem 320 - 2019 USA TSTST, P3 of 9</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>On an infinite square grid we place finitely many <i>cars</i>, which each occupy a single cell and face in one of the four cardinal directions. Cars may never occupy the same cell. It is given that the cell immediately in front of each car is empty, and moreover no two cars face towards each other in the same row or column (no right-facing car is to the left of a left-facing car within a row, etc.). In a <i>move</i>, one chooses a car and shifts it one cell forward to a vacant cell. Prove that there exists an infinite sequence of valid moves using each car infinitely many times.</p>
