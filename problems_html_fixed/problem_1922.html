<h1>Problem 1922 - 2024 Singapore China Western Mathematics Invitational TST, P2 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Let \(N\) be a positive integer. Tony and Wang play a game, Tony secretly tiles a \(260 \times 260\) board with dominoes. Wang then chooses a set of \(N\) cells from the board, and Tony reveals the positions of all dominoes which cover any of the \(N\) chosen cells. Wang now has to guess Tony's tiling, and wins if he does so correctly. What is the smallest value of \(N\) for which Wang can guarantee a win?</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>So for a lower bound on \(N\), note that we want every \(2 \times 2\) square to have <i>something</i>, maybe from the outside world, intersecting it because otherwise there are \(2\) possible domino-tilings for it. So I think that would give \(N \ge 260^2 / 8\). Oh wait, we actually have a bound of \(N \ge 260^2 / 4\) because if some \(2 \times 2\) does not have a mark, then there is definitely some tiling which does not cover this \(2 \times 2\) square at all, resulting in at least \(2\) distinct tilings.</p>
<p>The answer for \(2 \times 2\) is \(1\). The answer for \(4 \times 4\) seems like it should be \(4\). </p>
<p>Basically, all we want to do now is show that there are no `domino-cycles' that can have \( \ge 2\) permutations of dominoes by cyclically permuting inside it, <i>if</i> we know the locations of the \(n^2/4\) dominoes at the bottom-left squares of every \(2\times 2\). If such a cycle exists, it obviously should not go <i>through</i> any of the \(n^2/4\) marked squares. We would like to show that if it doesn't go through anything, it at least `<i>traps</i>' a marked square inside of it.</p>
<p>What if we show that for any normal cycle that doesn't pass through one of the marked squares, it must pass through an odd number of edges? But unfortunately, you can do this - the real failure is because of the marked squares inside the cycle not being able to tile with dominoes completely inside - it must intersect the cycle.</p>
<p>This leads to the realization that maybe with the added condition that the area inside the cycle is odd, the above statement is true - also that every cycle will have an even length. So we modify to: for any normal cycle that doesn't pass through one of the marked squares, the area inside must be odd. This is true - since the cycle's total area is the area of a bunch of continuous \(3 \times 3\) squares (\(9 + 6 + 6 + 6 + \dots\)) which is odd, and the boundary is even, the area inside must be odd. </p>
<p>Thus, there are no cycles for us to permute along (or rather, the resulting graph is a bunch of trees which can only be filled in one way), so we are done.</p>
</div>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>It's just a chain of failure-observations. An interesting thing to keep in mind is that a tree can only be tiled by dominoes in one way. In particular, we love odd cycles and trees - connection to bipartiteness?</p>
