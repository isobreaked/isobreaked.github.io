<h1>Problem 129 - 2018 EGMO, P6 of 6, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Prove that for every real number \(t\) such that \(0 < t < \tfrac{1}{2}\) there exists a positive integer \(n\) with the following property: for every set \(S\) of \(n\) positive integers there exist two different elements \(x\) and \(y\) of \(S\), and a non-negative integer \(m\) (i.e. \(m \ge 0\)), such that \[|x-my|\leq ty.\] Determine whether for every real number \(t\) such that \(0 < t < \tfrac{1}{2}\) there exists an infinite set \(S\) of positive integers such that \[|x-my| > ty\]for every pair of different elements \(x\) and \(y\) of \(S\) and every positive integer \(m\) (i.e. \(m > 0\)).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class = skib>
<p>We wish to show the existence of \(n \in \mathbf{N}\) such that for every set \(S \in \mathbf{N}^n\), there exist \(x \neq y \in S\) and \(m \in \mathbf{Z}_{\ge 0}\) such that
\[m-t \leq \frac{x}{y} \leq m + t\]
Suppose FTSOC that even for sufficiently large \(n\) there exists some set \(S\) such that for all \(x\), \(y \in S\), \(x/y\) is always in the interval \((z + t, z + 1 - t)\) for some \(z \in \mathbf{N}\). </p>
<p>It seems like we should take \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x < y\) - then this tells us that all \(x/y\) lie in \((t, 1 - t)\) no matter how large the set is. Suppose our set is \(\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}\) arranged in ascending order. Thus we have
\[x_1 < (1 - t)x_2 < (1 - t)^2 x_3 < \dots < (1 - t)^{n - 1}x_n\]
However, for sufficiently large \(n\) it must hold that \((1 - t)^{n - 1} < t\), so
\[x_1 < (1 - t)^{n - 1}x_n < tx_n \implies \frac{x_1}{x_n} < t\]
which is a contradiction to our assumption, proving the first part.</p>
<p>The second part asks us whether there is an infinite set such that for all \(x\), \(y\) in it, \(x/y\) is always in the interval \((z + t, z + 1 - t)\) for some \(z \in \mathbf{N}\), but the key part is that the interval \((t, 1-t)\) is replaced by just \( < 1 - t \). There is no lower bound of \( > t\), thus invalidating the above argument for finite sets. </p>
<p>Basically, if \(x < y\), then \(x/y < 1 - t\) should hold. The real fun happens when \(x > y\). Let us take \(t \sim 1/2\), in which case \(\{x/y\}\) will lie in \((0.5 - \epsilon, 0.5 + \epsilon)\). Looking at the conservation of this property multiplicatively is not as good of an idea here compared to the first part. I think the strategy is to take some \(n\) element set \(\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}\) such that all of their quotient fractional parts lie in \((0.5 - \epsilon, 0.5 + \epsilon)\) and show that we can append some \(x_{n+1}\) that works. </p>
<p>The first condition is just that \(x_{n+1} > x_n / (0.5 + \epsilon)\). Then we have 
\[\big\{\frac{x_n}{x_1}\big\} \in (0.5 - \epsilon, 0.5 + \epsilon), \;\; \big\{\frac{x_n}{x_2}\big\} \in (0.5 - \epsilon, 0.5 + \epsilon), \;\; \dots \;\;, \big\{\frac{x_n}{x_{n-1}}\big\} \in (0.5 - \epsilon, 0.5 + \epsilon)\]
If all of \(x_i\) for \(i < n\) were even, then life would be simpler since there exists <i>something</i> such that \(\{y/x_i\} = 0.5\), namely, anything such that \(y \equiv x_i / 2 \pmod{x_i}\). But this is not the case, and neither can we force everything to be even, because eventually the \(\nu_2\) must decrease enough to ensure there is an odd. Also unfortunately, note that we can't really use CRT since even numbers won't be coprime. </p>
<p>This gives us another idea - if we take \(x_1\) large and as a consequence all of \(x_i\) sufficiently large and manage to force all \(x_i\) coprime to each other, then we can force the existence of \(x_n \equiv \lfloor x_i/2 \rfloor \pmod{x_i}\) for all \(i < n\), which would be effectively \(0.5 - \delta\) for very small \(\delta\). Wait LOL you can take \(x_1\) sufficiently big prime and then just force \(x_2\) prime by Dirichlet, and then use CRT, obtain a modulus for \(x_3\), use Dirichlet to force \(x_3\) prime, and so on. So we're done.</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Part 1 is straightforward, but Part 2 is lowkey peak. See you realise that just random fraction multiplications won't work and induction looks very appealing. First one thinks that evens are desirable, but that is bound to fail for a multitude of reasons, as explained above - but the idea is correct. We learn from this failure and decide to force relatively prime instead of exact \(0.5\) (which we don't need in the first place for a reason). And what better to force relatively prime than prime. This tech is somewhat interesting - you want something to be relatively prime, so you obtain it's modulo with respect to previous terms,  use CRT, and then guarantee that it is prime by Dirichlet.</p>
<p>A learn-from-failure approach works well.</p>
