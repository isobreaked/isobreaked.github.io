<h1>Problem 1592 - A theorem of De Bruijn</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Show that if a rectangle can be tiled with smaller rectangles each of which has at least one integer side, then the tiled rectangle must have at least one integer side.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>A direct combinatorial solution seems hard - you really want to induct. But induction seems hard to carry out, still you would love to force it to work. <b>When you really really want to do something, and keep coming back to that same idea, force it to work.</b></p>
<p>In this case, you can't really induct on the size of the <i>grid</i>. It's easy to see that if you're inducting on anything, it's probably the number of tiles. Trying to make this work also somewhat fails directly. </p>
<p>You should <i>frame</i> EXACTLY what you want to do with words. You know you want to carry out induction. You know you want to remove <i>something</i> but you're not sure what. And you want to make sure that the resulting grid also has an integer side. We can try removing a row from the top or a row from the bottom, but this doesn't really work - the important thing to realise now is that we can divide integer sized tiles in grids. We were already thinking about some sort of minimum height tile in the top row, but if it goes down, then this minimum is \(1\) anyways.</p>
<p>In any case, we split everything into an integer number of \(1 \times x\) or an integer number of \(y \times 1\). We could now try to remove the top row of height \(1\) from the grid and induct on a particular kind of tile - but this kind of sort of fails. </p>
<p>So we edit the above strategy, we make a ``dynamic'' row of height \(1\), starting with WLOG the top-left most rectangle has height \(1\). Then, once it ends, there is either another 'horizontal' rectangle (which must have height \(1\)) touching it's rightmost end, or it's rightmost edge is completely covered by `vertical' rectangles. We will chew up these vertical rectangles by extending our dynamic row by width \(1\). </p>
<p>Again, we are either met with a completely vertical rectangle (but new vertical rectangles, since any vertical rectangle has width \(1\)) covered rightmost edge, or there is some horizontal rectangle. We keep doing this, and end up with a dynamic row of height \(1\) going straight to the other end, and removing this row, we end up with a grid with <i>fewer</i> horizontal rectangles than before. So induction works.</p>
