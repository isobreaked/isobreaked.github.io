<h1>Problem 2384 - 2024 India IMOTC, P6 of 24</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>At an IMOTC party, all people have pairwise distinct ages. Some pairs of people are friends and friendship is mutual. Call a person junior if they are younger than all their friends, and senior if they are older than all their friends. A person with no friends is both junior and senior. A sequence of pairwise distinct people \(A_1, \dots, A_m\) is called photogenic if:
1. \(A_1\) is junior,
2. \(A_m\) is senior, and
3. \(A_i\) and \(A_{i+1}\) are friends, and \(A_{i+1}\) is older than \(A_i\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq m-1\).</p>
<p>Let \(k\) be a positive integer such that for every photogenic sequence \(A_1, \dots, A_m\), \(m\) is not divisible by \(k\). Prove that the people at the party can be partitioned into \(k\) groups so that no two people in the same group are friends.</p>
