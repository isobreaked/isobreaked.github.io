<h1>Problem 2022 - 2022 IMO, P6 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>Let \(n\) be a positive integer. A <i>Nordic square</i> is an \(n \times n\) board containing all the integers from \(1\) to \(n^2\) so that each cell contains exactly one number. Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers is called a <i>valley</i>. An <i>uphill path</i> is a sequence of one or more cells such that:
<ol><li>the first cell in the sequence is a valley,</li><li>each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and</li><li>the numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.</li></ol>
Find, as a function of \(n\), the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square.</p>
