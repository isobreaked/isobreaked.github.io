<h1>Problem 733 - 2020 AUS â†’ UNK F3, P2 of 3</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>The city of Parth occupies an edge-connected group of \(n\) cells in an infinite square
grid such that, for any two cells in Parth in the same row or column, all the cells between
them are also in Parth. To increase tourism, the government wishes to build a single road
by connecting the centres of some cells sharing an edge, so that the road is infinite in both
directions and visits every cell exactly once. In planning, they notice that no matter how they
design their road, the number of times the road passes from a cell in Parth to a cell outside of
Parth is fixed. For what values of \(n\) is this possible?</p>
