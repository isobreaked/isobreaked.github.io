<h1>Problem 649 - 2014 IMOSL, C7</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 9</h2>
<p>Let \(M\) be a set of \(n \ge 4\) points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Initially these points are connected with \(n\) segments so that each point in \(M\) is the endpoint of exactly two segments. Then, at each step, one may choose two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) sharing a common interior point and replace them by the segments \(AC\) and \(BD\) if none of them is present at this moment. Prove that it is impossible to perform \(n^3 /4\) or more such moves.</p>
