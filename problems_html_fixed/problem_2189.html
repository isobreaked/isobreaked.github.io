<h1>Problem 2189 - 2025 Israel TST, Test 2 P2</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>A simple graph with \(10^{100}\) vertices satisfies the following condition: Any simple odd cycle has length \(>100\). Prove there is an independent set in the graph of size at least \(\frac{10^{100}}{102}\)</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>I'm thinking of what happens when any simple odd cycle has length \(\ge 3\) - any graph works, so the guaranteed maximum independent set is of size \(1\). Interestingly, if there are no odd cycles, the graph is bipartite, and the guaranteed maximum independent set is of size \(10^{100}/2\), which means \(102\) is probably not just \(n + 1\) where cycles of \(< n\) don't exist (rephrasing as odd cycles are \(\ge 101\)). </p>
<p>What about when any odd cycle has length \(\ge 5\) - that is, no triangles? I don't know! Let's just skip to the main problem honestly, I can't care less about small cases at this point (ChatGPT has scared me). There are two approaches that I can think of: inductive (contradictive) construction, and the probabilistic method. Since the probabilistic method exists and does not exist at the same time, I'll go with the former approach. Suppose there is some graph with largest independent set of size \( < 10^{100}/102\). This means two things, which makes it suspicious - it means that every vertex is connected to at least one of the vertices in this set, but it also means that there is no <i>other</i> bigger independent set. </p>
<p>Suppose our independent set is \(S\) with \(|S| = s\), and note that every vertex in \(G\) is connected to some vertex in \(S\). This means that by PHP there is some vertex \(v\) in \(S\) connected to at least \(102\) other vertices in \(G\). Note that at most one of these vertices can be not connected to some other vertex in \(S\), since otherwise we get a bigger independent set (and this holds all elements in \(S\)). Thus, we can reformulate the last line to: ''for each \(u \in S\), there is at most one vertex in \(N(u)\) that is not connected to two elements of \(S\)''.</p>
<p>This is good! At least it ensures that none (Terms and Conditions Apply) of the \(102\) neighbours of \(v\) are just randomly a leaf. Wait, I sense a Hall-like condition. Any \(n\) vertices in \(N(u)\) for \(u \in S\) must be connected to at least \(n\) distinct vertices in \(S\) (this includes \(u\)), otherwise we can perform a replacement. This is very lukewarm.	The "no odd cycles of size \(\le 99\)" condition means that the distance \(i\) and distance \(j\) neighbours of \(v\) where \(i \equiv j \pmod{2}\) and \(i + j \le 98\) cannot be connected. What I want to happen is that if none of these things are connected then this should naturally form a bigger independent set or something. Let's just take \(i \equiv j \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\), and \(i, j \le 49\). If we then lack vertices, we will consider higher level neighbours. </p>
<p>So now we want to count the \(i\) level neighbours to our chosen vertex \(v\) with \(102\) neighbours. Let us look at the level \(3\) neighbours - by the Hall-like condition, the \(102\) vertices are connected to at least \(102\) distinct vertices in \(S\), which means there are on average \(10200\) level \(3\) things, but 'on average' is just depressing. Also this is not possible to continue further because the Hall-like condition just doesn't apply in general. So we need to find another way. </p>
<p>Oh! Suppose the \(102\) vertices have some \(n\) neighbours. Then the rest of the graph is of size \(10^{100} - 102 - n\), and we can find an independent set of size \(\ge \frac{10^{100} - 102 - n}{102}\) due to <b>induction</b> on the fact that any smaller graph \(G'\) has an independent set of size \(\ge |G'|/102\). This means that the total independent set becomes of size (the \(102\) vertices form a separate independent set due to the ban on odd cycles)
\[102 + \frac{10^{100} - 102 -n}{102} = \frac{10^{100}}{102} + \left( 102 - \frac{102 + n}{102} \right)\]
which is lesser than \(\frac{10^{100}}{102}\) if and only if \(n > 101 \cdot 102\). Ahhhh, in general if you have an independent set of \(k\) vertices, and it has \(n\) neighbours, then you want
\[\frac{10^{100}}{102} > k + \frac{10^{100} - k - n}{102} = \frac{10^{100}}{102} + \left( k - \frac{k + n}{102} \right) \implies \boxed{n > 101 \cdot k}\]
Okay actually since we want simple odd cycles, we can only consider the forward direction neighbours - but it's fine, we can just take \(n > 100 \cdot k\) and that's more than enough margin. In any case, all of this means that the level \(i\) neighbours of \(v\) are at least \(102 \cdot 100^{i - 1}\) in number. The level \(49\) neighbours are thus
\[102 \cdot 100^{48} > 10^{98} > \frac{10^{100}}{102}\]
So we didn't even need to consider the level \(i\) and level \(j\) neighbours with the weird parity constraints in the end!!!</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Beautiful problem. There's a bunch of conditions, and basically the whole solution is based off of figuring out which of these few conditions a certain bad thing 'should' contradict, and proving that it does. I'll call this process conditional contradiction chasing (CCC).</p>
<p>In the end, the main wall is just figuring out how many neighbours the \(102\) vertices should have, and you realise you're just stuck if they have only a few - you proceed with CCC and say that a bigger independent set forms if there are only a few vertices, motivating the induction automatically.</p>
<p>Of course, the internal belief in CCC is stronger if you know something <i>must</i> be true, otherwise you have to take a leap of faith. </p>
