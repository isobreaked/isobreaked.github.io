<h1>Problem 479 - 2009 IMO, P5 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Determine all functions \(f\) from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers such that, for all positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths
\[a, f(b) \text{ and } f(b + f(a) - 1).\]
(A triangle is non-degenerate if its vertices are not collinear.)</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class = 'skib'>
<p>
Note that \(1\), \(f(a)\), and \(f(a + f(1) - 1)\) form a triangle. This means that 
\[f(a) = f(a + f(1) - 1)\]
Thus \(f\) is periodic with period \(f(1) - 1\), which is non-zero periodicity unless \(f(1) = 1\). But note that if \(f\) is periodic with non-zero periodicity, then it is also bounded, so suppose the maximum of \(f\) is \(L\). We can take \(a >> 2L\), which has no shot of forming a triangle with sides \(f(x)\) and \(f(y)\), a contradiction. Thus \(f(1) = 1\).
</p>
<p>
Note that \(a\), \(f(1) = 1\), and \(f(f(a))\) form a triangle. This means that \(f(f(a)) = a\). From here, we get that \(a\), \(b\), and \(f(f(a)+f(b)-1)\) form a triangle, and \(f(a)\), \(f(b)\) and \(f(a+b-1)\) form a triangle. So we have
\[a + b - 1 \ge f(f(a) + f(b) - 1)\]
<p>
I think we should look at the fact that \(2\), \(b\), and \(f(f(b)+f(2)-1)\) form a triangle. This means that \(|f(f(b) + f(2) - 1) - b| \le 1\). Since \(f\) is an involution, \(f(f(b) + f(2) - 1) = b\) is not possible, since \(f(2) = 1\) is also not possible. So 
\[f(f(b) + f(2) - 1) = b \pm 1 \implies f(b) + f(2) - 1 = f(b \pm 1)\]
Let \(f(2) - 1 = c\) (which is non-zero), then \(f(b) + c = f(b \pm 1)\). Suppose \(b = 2\), then unless something obviously absurd, \(f(2) + c = f(3)\). Suppose \(b = 3\), then \(f(3) + c = f(2)\) cannot happen because literally \(f(3) = f(2) + c\). In similar fashion, we get \(f(b) = 1 + c(b-1)\), due to involution, \(c = 1\) and \(f(b) = b\) for all \(b\), which works.

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>
Nothing to see here, the short leap is just looking at \(2\) which finishes.
