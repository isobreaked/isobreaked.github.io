<h1>Problem 781 - 2020 USEMO, P2 of 6</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Calvin and Hobbes play a game. First, Hobbes picks a family \(F\) of subsets of \(\{1, 2, . . . , 2020\}\), known to both players. Then, Calvin and Hobbes take turns choosing a number from \(\{1, 2, . . . , 2020\}\) which is not already chosen, with Calvin going first, until all numbers are taken (i.e., each player has \(1010\) numbers). Calvin wins if he has chosen all the elements of some member of \(F\), otherwise Hobbes wins. What is the largest possible size of a family \(F\) that Hobbes could pick while still having a winning strategy?</p>
