<h1>Problem 556 - 2004 Balkan MO, P4 of 4</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>The plane is partitioned into regions by a finite number of lines no three of which are concurrent. Two regions are called ``neighbours&#x27;&#x27; if the intersection of their boundaries is a segment, or half-line or a line (a point is not a segment). An integer is to be assigned to each region in such a way that:
<ol><li>the product of the integers assigned to any two neighbours is less than their sum;</li><li>for each of the given lines, and each of the half-planes determined by it, the sum of the integers, assigned to all of the regions lying on this half-plane equal to zero.</li></ol>
Prove that this is possible if and only if not all of the lines are parallel.</p>
