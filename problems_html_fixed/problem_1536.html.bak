<h1>Problem 1536 - 2023 Australian Training Tournament, P7 of 7</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>A group of 100 people are divided into three teams so that no two people in the same team are friends. The group is called <i>special</i> if there is exactly one way of doing this. What is the smallest possible number of friendships in a special group of 100 people?</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Obviously, the bound part is the main part of the problem - if one realises the
significance of \(2n - 3\) as arising from three trees, then they are done, but of course,
thatâ€™s a crazy way to think. A better way to come up with the bound is I think to
be motivated from the depressing failure of forcedness not really existing and trying
to think along those lines about whether there can even exist a vertex of a particular
color not connected to some other color.</p>
