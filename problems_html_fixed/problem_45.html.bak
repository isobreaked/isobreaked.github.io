<h1>Problem 45 - 2017 IMOSL, N2, N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 6</h2>
<p>Let \(p \geq 2\) be a prime number. Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index \(i\) in the set \(\{0,1,\dots,p-1 \}\) that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element \(a_i\) of the set \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\). Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices \(i \in \{0,1,\dots,p-1\}\) have been chosen. Then the following number is computed: \[M = a_0 + 10\cdot a_1 + \dots + 10^{p-1} \cdot a_{p-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} a_j \cdot 10^j.\] The goal of Eduardo is to make the number \(M\) divisible by \(p\), and the goal of Fernando is to prevent this. Prove that Eduardo has a winning strategy.</p>
