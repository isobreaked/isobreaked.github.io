<h1>Problem 1936 - A</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Find all functions \(f:\mathbf N_+ \to \mathbf N_+,\) such that for all positive integers \(a\), \(b\),
\[\sum_{k=0}^{2b}f(a+k)=(2b+1)f(f(a)+b)\]</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Let us first substitute \(b = 1\) to see what is happening.
\[f(a) + f(a + 1) + f(a + 2) = 3f(f(a) + 1)\]
The only linear function that works is \(f(n) = n\). Subtracting \(P(a, b)\) from \(P(a, b + 1)\), we get
\[f(a + 2b + 1) + f(a + 2b + 2) = (2b + 3) f(f(a) + b + 1) - (2b + 1) f(f(a) + b)\]
But also subtracting \(P(a + 2, b - 1)\) from \(P(a + 2, b)\), we get
\[f(a + 2b + 1) + f(a + 2b + 2) = (2b + 1)f(f(a + 2) + b) - (2b - 1)f(f(a + 2) + b - 1)\]
Also note that 
\[f(a + 2b) + f(a + 2b + 1) + f(a + 2b + 2) = 3f(f(a + 2b) + 1)\]  
So we have a lot of interesting things. We also have divisibility obtained directly from the main equation, and things like
\[f(a) + 5f(f(a - 5) + 2) = 3f(f(a - 2) + 1) + 3f(f(a - 5) + 1)\]
</p>
<p>In any case, what I was thinking about right now was that if \(c = f(1) > 2\), then \(f(1) + f(2) + f(3) = 3f(c + 1)\), which means that if we fix the values of \(f(1)\) to \(f(c)\) and \(k\) is the maximum of these, then \(f\) is a bounded function with maximum value \(k\) - wait, why? Let us deal with this case later. Suppose instead that \(f(1) = 2\), which means 
\[f(1) + f(2) + f(3) = 3f(3) \]
\[f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + f(5) = 5f(4)\]
\[f(1) + f(2) + \dots + f(2b + 1) = (2b + 1)f(b + 2)\] </p>

<h1>Problem 1601 - N</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 7</h2>
<p>Fix a nonnegative integer \(a_0\) to define a sequence of integers \(a_0\), \(a_1\), \(\ldots\) by letting \(a_k\) (\( k\geq 1 \)) be the smallest integer (strictly) greater than \(a_{k-1}\) such that \(a_{k-1}+a_k\) is a perfect square. Let \(S{}\) be the set of positive integers not expressible as the difference of two terms of the sequence \((a_k)_{k\geq 0}\). Prove that \(S\) is finite and determine its size in terms of \(a_0.\)</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>First note that when \(a_0 = 0\) or \(a_0 = 1\) (or any triangular number, for that matter), then the sequence we have is that of the triangular numbers
\[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots\]
This clearly results in a finite set of numbers that cannot be expressed as a difference - in the case of \(a_0 = 0\), there is no such integer. In the case of \(a_0 = T_n\), the \(n\)th triangular number (if \(T_0 = 0\)), we miss the numbers from \(1\) to \(n\). </p>
<p>Let us confirm or deny the following hypothesis: if \(b\) is the smallest number bigger than \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a perfect square, then \(a\) is the biggest number smaller than \(b\) such that \(a + b\) is a perfect square. From the perspective of \(a\), the square obtained in its procedure should be the smallest square above \(2a\). From the perspective of \(b\), the square obtained in its procedure should be the biggest square below \(2b\). The statement then becomes, suppose \(a + b\) is the smallest square \( > 2a\), show that it is the biggest square \( < 2b\). FTSOC assume that there is a bigger square \(< 2b\). Suppose this square is \(2b - k\), then since \(a + b\) and \(2b - k\) are both consecutive squares, \(2a + k + 2\) must also be a square bigger than \(2a\) but smaller than \(a + b\), a contradiction. In edge cases, it can also be \(a + b + 1\) or \(a + b + 2\) but this is easily eliminated since no two squares have a difference of \(1\) or \(2\). (okay, this argument was peak 'why things are true' analysis). </p>
<p>Great, moving on. Look at the terms \(a_{n-1}\), \(a_n\) and \(a_{n+1}\). Since \(a_{n-1}\) is the biggest number lesser than \(a_n\) such that \(a_{n-1} + a_n\) is a perfect square, and \(a_{n+1}\) is the smallest number bigger than \(a_n\) such that \(a_n + a_{n+1}\) is a perfect square, these two must be consecutive squares, <i>unless</i> \(2a_n\) is a perfect square. Is it possible to show that \(n = 0\) is the only value for which \(2a_n\) is a perfect square? Okay - suppose some \(a_n = k^2/2\) for \(n > 0\). Then \(a_{n-1} + a_n\) cannot be \(k^2\), and must be \((k - 1)^2\). 
\[a_{n-1} = \frac{k^2}{2} - 2k + 1\]
\[(k - 2)^2 - a_{n-1} = \frac{k^2}{2} - 2k + 3 > a_{n-1}\]
This means that in fact there is no \(a_{n-1}\) such that \(a_n\) is half of a square - only \(a_0\) can be. So indeed \(a_n + a_{n-1}\) and \(a_n + a_{n+1}\) are always consecutive squares. So if \(a_0 + a_1 = n^2\), then \(a_1 + a_2 = (n + 1)^2\), and so on, and taking the differences of form \(a_{i + 2} - a_i\), we get all the odd numbers \(\ge 2n + 1\). Since \(a_0 + a_1 = n^2\), we must have \((n-1)^2/2 \le a_0 < n^2/2\). 
\[a_0 = \frac{n^2}{2} - d, \;\;\;\; a_1 = \frac{n^2}{2} + d, \;\;\;\; a_2 = \frac{n^2}{2} + 2n + 1 - d, \;\;\;\; a_3 = \frac{n^2}{2} + 2n + 3 + d, \;\;\;\; \dots\]
\[a_1 - a_0 = 2d, \;\;\;\; a_3 - a_2 = 2d + 2, \;\;\;\; \dots\]
\[a_2 - a_1 = 2n + 1 - 2d, \;\;\;\; a_4 - a_3 = 2n + 3 - 2d\]
So all the even numbers \(\ge 2d\) are covered, and all the odd numbers \(\ge 2n + 1 - 2d\) are covered. It is clear that no even number smaller than \(2d\) can be covered, and no odd number smaller than \(2n + 1 - 2d\) can be covered. Thus \(d - 1\) even numbers are not covered, and \(n - d\) odd numbers are not covered, giving a total of \(n - 1 = \lfloor 2 \sqrt{a_0} \rfloor\) numbers not covered.

<h1>Problem 2253 - G</h1>
<h2 class='difficulty'>Difficulty: 8</h2>
<p>Let \(ABC\) be a acute triangle and \(E\), \(F\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively such that \(E\), \(F\), \(C\), \(B\) lie on one circle. Let \(P\) be the intersection of \(BF\) and \(CE\). Let \(M\) and \(N\) be the midpoints of \(BC\) and \(AP\) respectively. Let \(X\) be the normal projection of \(P\) onto \(AB\). Prove that 
\[\angle MXN + \angle BFC=180^{\circ}\]</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>This is quadrilateral config, not triangle config. Actually wait, in terms of triangle config, this is generalized NPC. Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>\(NX = NY\) since circle \((APXY)\) has center \(N\).</li>
<li>\(MX = MY\) due to complex bash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we wish to show \(\angle MXN = \angle MYN = 180^{\circ} - \angle BFC\), we want 
\[\angle XMY = 360^{\circ} - (360^{\circ} - 2\angle BFC) - \angle XNY = 2 \angle BFC - 2 \angle BAC = 2 \angle EBF\]
So we can remove \(A\) and \(N\) from the problem, and restate in terms of a pure quadrilateral problem. But also note that if \(Z\) is the foot of \(P\) onto \(BC\), then we know \(\angle XZY = \angle XBP + \angle PCY = 2 \angle EBF\). So really what we want to show is that \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\), \(M\) are concyclic. Since \(ZP\) is the internal angle bisector of \(\angle XZY\), the line \(ZM\) must be the external angle bisector. Hence, the point \(M'\) where \(XM\) intersects the circle \((XYZ)\) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \(XY\). Since \(MX = MY\), \(M' = M\) must hold, and we are done.</p>
