<p>Continuing the number theoretic sequence trajectory.</p>
<h1>Example 1</h1>
<p>Let \(f\), \(g \in \mathbf{Z}[X]\) be two nonconstant polynomials such that \(f(n) \mid g(n)\) for infinitely many \(n\). Prove that \(f\) divides \(g\) in \(\mathbf{Q}[X]\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
  <p>Since \(f(n) \mid g(n)\) for infinitely many \(n\), \(\deg f < \deg g\). Divide \(g\) by \(f\) in \(\mathbf{Q}[X]\) such that \(g = qf + r\). Let the numbers such that \(f(n) \mid g(n)\) be \(n_1\), \(n_2\), \(\dots\). Mutliplying \(g = qf + r\) by some big LCM of denominators, we get \(Lg = q'f + r'\), where \(q'\) and \(r'\) are integer polynomials. For \(n_i\), this becomes
    \[Lkf(n_i) = Lg(n_i) = q'(n_i)f(n_i) + r'(n_i) \implies f(n_i) \mid r'(n_i) \;\; \forall i\]
    But \(|f(n_i)| > |r'(n_i)|\) for sufficiently large \(i\) due to \(r'\) having lesser degree than \(f\). Thus \(r'(n_i)\) is \(0\) for all large \(i\), implying it (and thus \(r\)) is the zero polynomial.
  </p>  
</div>
<h2>PFTB solution</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>PFTB deals with this problem in basically the same way but phrases it as: \(\{Lr(n_i)/f(n_i)\} = \{r'(n_i)/f(n_i)\}\) is an <b>integer sequence</b> that converges to \(0\), which means it stabilizes at \(0\) eventually. Note that \(\{r(n_i)/f(n_i)\}\) also converges to \(0\), but since it isn't an integer sequence, that really doesn't mean anything.</p>
</div>
<h1>Example 2</h1>
<p>Let \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) be integers with \(a \neq 0\) such that \(an^2 + bn + c\) is a perfect square for any positive integer \(n\). Prove that there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(a = x^2\), \(b = 2xy\), \(c = y^2\).</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div class=skib>
  <p>Plugging \(n = 0\) implies \(c = y^2\) for some \(y\).
    \[\left(\sqrt{a} n + \frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2 = an^2 + bn + \frac{b^2}{4a} = x_n^2 - \left(c - \frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\]
    where \(\{x_i\}\) is the integer sequence \(\sqrt{an^2 + bn + c}\). The sequence \(\{x_n - \sqrt{a} n\}\) is convergent, but not an integer sequence. To obtain a convergent integer sequence from this, we can just notice that \(\{x_{n+1} - x_n\}\) converges to \(\sqrt{a}\), implying \(\sqrt{a}\) is an integer - \(a = x^2\). Now we can say that \(\{x_n - x n\}\) is a convergent integer sequence, so \(x_n = xn + r\) for large \(n\). This means \(ax^2 + bx + c = (xn + r)^2\) for infinitely many \(n\), thus meaning the polynomials are the same, and we are done.
  </p>  
</div>
<h1>Example 4 (Gabriel Dospinescu).</h1>
<p>Let \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(\dots\), \(a_k\) be positive real numbers such that at least one of them is not an integer. Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers \(n\) such that \(n\) and \(\lfloor a_1 n \rfloor + \lfloor a_2 n \rfloor + \dots + \lfloor a_k n \rfloor \) are relatively prime. 
</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
  <p>Let \(a_i = \{a_i\}\), so \(0 \le a_i < 1\). Then assuming the contrary we get that
    \[\frac{\lfloor a_1 p \rfloor + \lfloor a_2 p \rfloor + \dots + \lfloor a_k p\rfloor}{p}\]
    is an integer sequence for sufficiently large prime \(p\). But how does it behave? Well, it converges to \(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k\), so that must be an integer. Moreover, we get
    \[\lfloor a_1 p \rfloor + \lfloor a_2 p \rfloor + \dots + \lfloor a_k p\rfloor = a_1p + a_2p + \dots + a_kp \implies a_i p \in \mathbf{Z} \;\; \forall i\]
    But this is also true for all sufficiently large primes, so this means \(a_i = 0\) for all \(i\), a contradiction to the problem statement.
  </p>  
</div>
<p>The above is exactly the solution given in PFTB as well. Indeed, we're starting to get the 2023 N5 vibe. PFTB now says, "Step by step, we start to build some experience in 'guessing' the sequences", which is exactly what I started this for. Peak.</p>
<p>A common theme I've noticed is that you basically want the constant term to 'fall off' by only caring about the larger 'degree' things. And the way to only care about the larger degree things is to take \(n \to \infty\).</p>
<h1>Example 8 (Putnam 2007).</h1>
<p>Find all polynomials \(f\) with real coefficients such that if \(n\) is a positive integer which is written in base \(10\) only with ones, then \(f(n)\) has the same property. </p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
  <p>
Let the degree of this polynomial be \(d > 0\) (constant polynomials \(= 11\dots 1\) work). We have the condition
\[f\left(\frac{10^i - 1}{9}\right) = \frac{10^{g(i)} - 1}{9}\] 
\[\frac{10^{g(i)-di}}{c/9^d} \sim \frac{f\left(\frac{10^i - 1}{9}\right)}{{c \cdot 10^{di}}/{9^d}}  \to 1 \implies 10^{g(i) - di} \sim \frac{c}{9^{d-1}}\]
Therefore \(\{g(i) - di\}\), an integer sequence, converges to a value \(x\) and thus becomes constant at it eventually. Thus \(g(i) = x + di\) for large \(i\), and 
\[f\left(\frac{10^i - 1}{9}\right) = \frac{10^{di + x} - 1}{9} \implies f(n) = \frac{10^x(9n+1)^d-1}{9}\]
  </p>  
</div>
<h1>Example 9 (ToT 1982, Russia TST 1997, Bulgaria 2003).</h1>
<p>Let \(f\) be a monic polynomial with integer coefficients such that for any positive integer \(n\) the equation \(f(x) = 2^n\) has at least one positive integer solution. Prove that \(\deg f = 1\).</p>
<h2>PFTB solution</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>
Let \(d\) be the degree of \(f\), and \(x_n\) be the positive integer such that \(f(x_n) = 2^n\). Then \(x_n \sim 2^{n/d}\). We know that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n+d}/2x_n = 1\). Consider the sequence \(\{x_{n+d} - 2x_n\}\) - using \(f(x_{n+d}) = 2^d f(x_n)\), we get
\[\sum_{i=0}^d a_i(2^d x_n^i - x_{n+d}^i) = 0 \implies \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i(2^d x_n^i - x_{n+d}^i) = x_{n+d}^d - (2x_n)^d \implies x_{n+d} - 2x_n = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i(2^d x_n^i - x_{n+d}^i)}{\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} (2x_n)^i x_{n+d}^{d-i-1}}\]
Using \(x_{n+d}/x_n \to 2\), we obtain that \(\{x_{n+d} - 2x_n\}\) is indeed convergent, and being an integer sequence, after some point we have \(x_{n+d} = 2x_n + e\) for some \(e\). Thus we have \(f(2x + e) = 2^d f(x)\) for all sufficiently large \(x\), and since \(2^d\) is a constant, taking the polynomial \(g(x) = f(2x + e) - 2^df(x)\), we get that it is identically zero - thus \(f(2x + e) = 2^d f(x) \) for all \(x\). 
</p>  
<p>Now consider any complex root \(z\) of \(f\), in which case \(2z + e\), \(4z + 3e\), and so on, all become roots of \(f\). In order for the number of roots to be finite, \(2^r z + (2^r - 1) e = 2^s z + (2^s - 1) e\) must hold, which means the only root is \(z = -e\), giving the polynomial \(f(x) = (x + e)^d\). However, this polynomial does not yield positive integer solutions to \(f(x) = 2^n\) for all \(n\) unless \(d = 1\), so we are done.</p>
</div>
<p>What a problem.</p>

<h1>Example 11 (AMM).</h1>
<p>Let \(\pi(n)\) be the number of prime numbers not exceeding \(n\). Prove that there exist infinitely many \(n\) such that \(\pi(n) \mid n\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>
Suppose this is not true, in which case after a certain number \(N\), no \(n\) satisfies \(\pi(n) \mid n\). Choose the first prime \(p_1 > N\). Let \(\pi(p_1) = \psi\). Then, the next prime \(p_2\) must satisfy \(p_2 < p_1 + \psi - 1\), \(p_3\) must satisfy \(p_3 < p_1 + (\psi - 1) + (\psi)\). Continuing a weak bound like this gives nothing. </p>
<p>Having taken a hint from the book, now I know that all integer values are to be covered in the sequence \(n/\pi(n)\). Suppose \(n/\pi(n)\) does not take the value \(k\). The only values of \(n\) for which it could have taken the value \(k\) are obviously of the form \(km\). Let \(M\) be the biggest value such that \(kM/\pi(kM) < k\), which exists since \(n/\pi(n) \to \infty\). This means \(\pi(kM) \ge M + 1\). Then 
\[k < \frac{k(M+1)}{\pi(k(M + 1))} \le \frac{k(M+1)}{\pi(kM)} \le k\]
which is a clear contradiction to our assumption. Thus, \(n/\pi(n)\) indeed covers all sufficiently large positive integers, which means \(\pi(n) \mid n\) for infinitely many \(n\), and we are done.
</p>  
</div>
<p>In fact, the above problem holds true for <i>any sequence</i> \(f(n)\) such that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} n/f(n) = \infty\).</p>

<h1>Example 12 (AMM 10369).</h1>
<p>Let \(f\) be a polynomial with rational coefficients, of degree at least \(2\), and let \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) be a sequence of rational numbers such that \(f(a_{n+1}) = a_n\) for all \(n\). Prove that this sequence is periodic.</p>

<h1>Exercise 4.</h1>
<p>Prove that any infinite arithmetical sequence contains infinitely many terms that are not perfect powers.</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>
Surely this is the reciprocal trick. Note that if there are only finitely many non-power terms, then from a certain point on, everything is powers. The sums of reciprocals of all the powers is something that we know converges because
\[\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \sum_{i=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^i} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n-1)} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{n_{\to \infty}} = 1\]
Since there are only finitely many non-power terms, the sum of reciprocals of all the terms in this arithmetic progression must converge. However, supposing \(a < kd\) for some \(k\),
\[\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a+id} > \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(k+i)d} = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k+i} \to \infty \]
so we're done.
</p>  
<p>Well, of course, another 'trivial' way to prove this is to cite Dirichlet.</p>
