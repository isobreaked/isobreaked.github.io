<p>Here's the mock: <a href='./RMO1.pdf'>clickie</a>. Have fun! Spoilers below.</p>
<p>To be honest, this was really fun to make and see how some people did decently well and some people thought it was really hard. </p>
<h1>Problem 1</h1>
<p>This problem asks you to show that there is a number \(x\) such that \(x^2 \equiv -7 \pmod{2^n}\) for all \(n\) (those who know will call this a quadratic residue). This is a similar to Hensel-proof induction argument, easy to come up with even if you have not seen it before (add \(2^{n-1}\) or stay the same).</p>
<h1>Problem 2</h1>
<p>This was originally from the MEMO (I believe), the problem did not give the value \(6n^2\), and was originally a 2-part problem. I tried to make it easier by including this value, asking one to only show the bound. Still it is quite a nontrivial problem.</p>
<h1>Problem 3</h1>
<p>Trigbashable geometry, as is (or used to be?) usual for the RMO.</p>
<h1>Problem 4</h1>
<p>Inequality. Yeah. I don't know about this one.</p>
<h1>Problem 5</h1>
<p>Very interesting and nice problem from the Canada MO. Many intuitively think of this as an \(n\)-dimensional space. </p>
<h1>Problem 6</h1>
<p>Objectively the easiest problem on the mock. </p>
