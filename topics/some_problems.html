<p>Find all functions \(f : \mathbf{Z}_{> 0} \to \mathbf{Z}_{> 0}\) such that for all positive integers \(m\), \(n\):
\[mf(n+1) + f(n)f(m+1) \mid f(mn+1) + mf(n)\]
and \(\gcd(f(n), f(n+1)) = 1\).</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>Interestingly, nothing completely linear without pointwise \(1\)s works, and the only constant function that works is, of course, \(f(n) \equiv 1 \).
\[f(n+1) + f(n)f(2) \mid f(n+1) + f(n) \implies f(2) = 1\]
\[m + f(1)f(m+1) \mid f(m+1) + mf(1) \implies m + f(1)f(m+1) \le f(m+1) + mf(1) \implies f(m+1)(f(1) - 1) \le m(f(1)  -1)\]
So either \(f(1) = 1\) or \(f(m+1) \le m\) for all \(m \ge 1\).
\[m + f(1)f(m+1) \mid f(m+1) + mf(1) \implies m + f(1)f(m+1) \mid f(m+1)(f(1)^2 - 1) \implies m \le f(m+1)(f(1)^2 - f(1) - 1)\]
So again, either \(f(1) = 1\) or \(m \le f(m+1)(f(1)^2 - f(1) - 1)\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(f(1) = 1\). This is useless. 
\[mf(3) + f(m+1) \mid f(2m + 1) + m\]
\[2f(m+1) + f(3)f(m) \mid f(2m + 1) + 2f(m)\]
Okay, let's suppose \(f(m +1 ) \le m \le f(m+1)(f(1)^2 - f(1) - 1)\) and simply not care about \(f(1)\) (although we will have to, later). Never mind, I think we have to do casework and show some things like
<ul>
<li>If there are infinitely many \(1\)s then \(f\) is identically \(1\).</li>
<li>Else consider the point after which there are no \(1\)s.
</ul>

<h2>Thinking a few days later, and with the power of love</h2>
<div class=skib>
<p>We first observed that if \(f(1) = k\) for any \(k\), then \(f(n) = n - 1\) otherwise is a working function. So \(f(1)\) is really very useless and the \(f(1) = 1\) or \(f(m + 1) \le m\) constraint is very depressing because \(f(1) = 1\) can just be true whenever it wants. Then using some simple substitutions, we observed that something like \(f(i) = 1\) for \(i \in [1, c]\) for some \(c\), and \(f(n) = n -1\) otherwise, is <i>not</i> a working function. We then noticed these interesting facts:
\[m \mid f(m + 1) \implies m \mid f(m n + 1)\] 
\[m \mid f(n) \implies m \mid f(mn + 1)\]</p>
<p>Then we got the first real bit of progress - if we substitute \(m \to f(n)\), then we obtain 
\[f(n) \mid f(nf(n) + 1)\]
which also means \(f(n) \nmid f(nf(n))\) if \(f(n) \neq 1\). In any case, this proves to be very useful, since substituting now \(m \to mf(m)\) in the main equation, we get
\[f(m) \mid f(nmf(m) + 1) \;\; \forall n\]
which again means \(f(m) \nmid f(nmf(m))\) if \(f(m) \neq 1\). But now we get something even better - by plugging in \(n \to nf(n)\), we obtain
\[mf(nf(n) + 1) + f(nf(n)) f(m + 1) \mid f(mnf(n) + 1) + mf(nf(n))\]
Indeed, this means that if \(f(n) \mid f(m + 1)\), then \(f(n) \mid m\), which is sensational. It first implies by taking \(n = m + 1\), that 
\[f(m + 1) \mid m\]
and furthermore from the main equation, it implies
\[f(m + 1) \mid f(mn + 1)\]</p>
<p>Now it is time to cook. Since \(f(p + 1) \mid p\) for primes \(p\), I would like to show that it is not possible that \(f(p + 1) = p\) and \(f(q + 1) = 1\) for distinct primes \(p\), \(q\). Substituting, 
\[p + pf(q) \mid f(pq + 1) + pf(q)\]
\[pq + f(p) \mid f(pq + 1) + qf(p)\]

\[mf(n+1) + f(n)f(m+1) \mid f(mn+1) + mf(n)\]
\[pf(q + 2) + p \mid f(pq + p + 1) + p\]
\[qf(p + 2) + p \mid f(pq + q + 1) + qp\]
